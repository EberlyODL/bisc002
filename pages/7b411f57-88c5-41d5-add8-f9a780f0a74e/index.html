<p>The study of embryos has provided evidence to support the idea of a common ancestor among different species. In the very early development of different animals, embryos look very much the same. The following graphic shows how similar the embryos look among very different species.</p><p></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span class="lightbox-processed"><img alt="Image courtesy of Professor Kenneth R.

Indeed a lizard embryo and human embryo are quite similar at the earliest stages. Clearly these organisms develop into very different creatures but the beginning structures are the same. This shows how an ancestor species had a development plan for cell specialization that has been used by many, even wildly different, species as a basis for the creation of a newborn organism.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><script type="text/javascript" src="https://content.bitsontherun.com/players/pbFi8VnO-2pHRl6he.js"></script></p>
