<div class="art-postcontent"><div class="art-article"><p style="text-align: justify;">Of these major extinctions a few are worthy of special note. The <strong>3</strong><strong>rd</strong><strong> great extinction</strong> occurred at the end of the Permian era. This was the largest of all the mass extinctions. Somewhere in the region of&nbsp;95% of all species in existence at the time became extinct. This was a time of great change as the continents were merging together to form one huge continent, Pangea.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As a result, with only one large landmass, the rest of the planet was one huge ocean. Since most of the life on the planet is found near the coasts, a merging of landmass leads to a reduction in coastal habitats and a reduction in the number of organisms present. The loss of many shallow seas in favor of the formation of a huge deep ocean caused many global climactic changes. Such changing times had a profound impact on the climate and it's this rapid climate change that led to the loss of most organisms in existence at the time.</p></div></div>
