<div class="art-postcontent"><div class="art-article"><p>Modern medicine allows us to screen individual for the presence of defective alleles. Past practices involved collecting extensive medical histories of families to gain information about the genotype of an individual. Often times the only way to know was to have offspring afflicted with a particular disease. This is changing as we add more tests to detect genetic diseases. However, what is done with this knowledge becomes a matter of intense debate.</p><p><span class="lightbox-processed"><img alt="" class="lightbox" src="http://courses.ed.science.psu.edu/bisc002/sites/courses/ed/bisc002/files/bisc002/images/Screen.jpg" style="width: 524px; height: 448px;" title=""></span></p><p>Prenatal Screening is commonly done before birth to detect the presence of genetic defects. Sample fetal cells are used to determine biochemical and genetic characteristics of an unborn baby. The procedure of Amniocenteses involves the removal of amniotic fluid with a needle from the pregnant mother. In this way it's possible to acquire some fetal cells for testing.</p><p>Cells are used to check Karyotype, or the collection of all chromosomes to look for abnormalities. Here the cells are locked into the middle portion of mitosis where the chromosomes are visible and a picture is taken of the cell. Since the chromosomes are visible they can be paired up visually to see if the proper number is present. This is how one can tell if a baby has Down's syndrome. There would be three of chromosome 21.</p><p>After birth, newborn genetic screening can be performed. Newborn genetic screening is a health program that identifies treatable genetic disorders in newborn infants. Early treatment of these disorders can eliminate or reduce symptoms that might otherwise cause a lifetime of disability. Newborn genetic screening programs are conducted worldwide. In the United States, newborn screening programs are developed and run by individual states. Each state decides which disorders to test for and how to cover the costs of screening. The state of Pennsylvania routinely offers screening for a wide variety of genetic conditions. Some of this testing is required by law, no exceptions, while other tests are options if the parents so choose to have the test done.</p><p>Biochemical tests are also done to determine enzyme function and identify certain other diseases. Lastly, genetic sequencing verifies specific genes and detects genetic diseases. For example there is a test for a breast cancer gene. If this gene is found it indicates an increased likelihood of developing the illness. Since this is also a very treatable disease if detected early, it simply means that a woman should undergo frequent mammograms to be on the lookout for developing problems.</p><p>Some medical problems with such testing include the fact that they may only detect predisposition or increased risk for a certain illness. It doesn't mean someone will have developed a disease. Since there are very few treatments let alone cures for such diseases, is the screening beneficial? It's common that effective treatments may lag decades behind development of diagnostics. However, progress in gene therapy gives some hope that in fact, such disease may be curable one day. So it seems there may be uses for genetic screening.</p><p>The use of these tests brings up several significant issues. There are many ethical dilemmas that arise. As groups of people are identified with particular traits, there may be a tendency to label the group and discriminate against them. Who should have access to our genetic profiles, insurance companies, employers? Should such screening be voluntary or mandatory? One could make an argument that certain traits should not be permitted to be passed on to children in the name of a healthier population. Should someone be denied permission to marry and have children? There are many, many issues to consider regarding the use of information gained from genetic screening.</p></div></div><p></p>
