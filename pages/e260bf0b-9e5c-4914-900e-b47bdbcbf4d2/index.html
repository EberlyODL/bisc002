<div class="art-postcontent"><div class="art-article"><p>Alfred Russel Wallace is not remembered by history as the father of evolution. That title went to Charles Darwin. However, Wallace was doing the same sort of thinking that Darwin was and he reached many of the same conclusions as Darwin even though both were working independently of each other.</p>

<p>Wallace spent time in the Amazon jungle and in Southeast Asia studying the animals and plants of the natural world. He collected tens of thousands of specimens in his travels. Wallace had read Malthus' publication and his ideas about the struggle for survival. This also fit his observations of animals in the jungle. Wallace also noted that if an individual of a species had a variation that made it more efficient&nbsp;at&nbsp;finding food or perhaps avoiding a predator, then that individual would be more likely to survive to produce&nbsp;offspring and therefore pass on the helpful trait. Eventually over many generations of such offspring the descendants of the population would grow away from the ancestors. Thus the species could evolve.</p>
<p>Having come up with a mechanism for the change or evolution of a species, Wallace sent a paper to the eminent geologist, Charles Lyell, to present it to the Linnean Society meeting in London. Those who were familiar with Charles Darwin's ideas suggested that he also present his findings at the same meeting. Darwin had worked out his ideas earlier but had resisted publishing them for more than a decade. Knowing that Wallace had reached similar conclusions, Darwin also presented his ideas at the same time.</p>
<p>Unfortunately for Wallace, Darwin also had begun writing a book called <em>On the Origin of Species</em>. When published, this book became an instant sensation, partly due to the controversial nature of what Darwin's ideas implied about the origins of humans. This book&nbsp;completely overshadowed Wallace's earlier paper and therefore Darwin is credited with the basis for the theory of evolution.</p></div></div>
