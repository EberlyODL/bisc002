<p>When new species come about from a common ancestor this is referred to as adaptive radiation. Darwin's finches are a classic example of this form of speciation by adaptive radiation. When a species finds itself isolated, say on an island, far from any other members of it's species with which to mate, small changes in form can occur. These changes can allow the single species to take advantage of the local ecosystem to enhance its survival.</p><script src="https://content.bitsontherun.com/players/i3FmIX0D-2pHRl6he.js" type="text/javascript">
	</script><p>Darwin noted that the birds of the Galapagos were similar yet different from the birds on the mainland of South America. If a small flock of the mainland birds, adapted to eating seeds were to find themselves trapped on the Galapagos islands, they would have a wide variety of food sources available to them. As changes occurred to the birds over the generations in beak structure, some birds would be able to eat a food source that the other could not. Thus some birds would have a change in beak structure allowing them to eat insects instead of just seeds and they would have a huge advantage over the rest of the flock who could only eat seeds. From one species, a whole host of new bird species would evolve, each with a slightly different beak structure allowing it to take advantage of a unique food source. Bird species could evolve to eat seeds or insects or grubs or fruit or leaves. This adaptive radiation is also referred to as Divergent Evolution where many species evolved from a common ancestor.</p><p><img alt="" src="http://courses.ed.science.psu.edu/bisc002/sites/courses/ed/bisc002/files/bisc002/pic006.jpg" style="width: 310px; height: 491px;"></p>
