Some of the specimens from the Galapagos had never been&nbsp;seen before. True, they were similar to birds on the South American mainland, some hundreds of miles away, yet they were different in subtle ways. Could these birds be the descendants of some stray flock that had been blown off course to the island many years ago? Was it possible that these birds were originally from the mainland, but having been isolated on the islands for so many generations that they had developed along slightly different lines?</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Darwin needed to understand more about how different breeds of plants and animals are formed. He spoke with farmers about animal breeding as well as those who raised pigeons. Pigeon racing was a popular sport at the time and many enthusiasts were trying to breed pigeons with specific traits (sort of like the breeders that enter horses in the Kentucky Derby each year). This presented him with information that pigeons, for example, naturally possessed a&nbsp;wide variety of traits and that these traits could be passed on to succeeding generations. Darwin eventually became convinced that life evolves.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Darwin's ideas about living organisms changing slowly over time differed from others before him, like his grandfather Erasmus and Lamarck. Darwin viewed the history of life as a branching tree, much like a genealogical diagram rather than a linear development of organisms over time. He thought that over succeeding generations each branch formed a new line that could develop over time into something different. However not all lines continued on forever, some died off. This concept was firmed up when Darwin read a book written by a political economist who gave him the insight into how a mechanism for this could work.</p></div></div>
