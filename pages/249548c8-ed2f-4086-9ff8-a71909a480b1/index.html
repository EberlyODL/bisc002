<p class="art-postheader">The trip to the South Pacific proved to be a life changing experience for Darwin as he was able to practice his interests as an observer of living plants and animals for an extended period of time. This five year cruise took him to South America, the Galapagos Islands and many other islands in the South Pacific. During this time he was able to catalog many species in his notes and these were compiled into a book years later called the <em>Voyage of the Beagle</em>.</p>

<p>Darwin had the opportunity of a lifetime for a student of the natural world, because he was able to visit places that were very different from the countryside of rural England. He visited jungles and islands, some with active volcanoes. He was able to catalog differences in the insects and animals from very different places. Yet there were also similarities in creatures found thousands of miles apart. This led Darwin to ask a series of questions that were to haunt his thoughts&nbsp;for years, until he could come up with some sort of explanation.</p>
<p>The most obvious thing that impressed him was the huge variety of species he encountered. Why were&nbsp;there <em>so</em> <em>many</em> kinds of birds? Linnaeus listed 560 different bird species in his day, by 1909 this&nbsp;number had increased to many thousands more. If, as most people believed, each species was created to fill a unique environment, how could there be thousands and thousands of micro environments? He noted huge numbers of different exotic species from jungles in Asia, Africa and South America. Shouldn't all jungle bird species&nbsp;be pretty much the same if they live in a similar environment? Something just didn't add up for Darwin in relation to the commonly held beliefs of his time.</p>
