<div class="art-postcontent"><div class="art-article"><p>While point mutations involve the changing of one letter in the DNA sequence into another letter they do not involve the loss or gain of letters in the sequence. A codon may change but all other codons remain intact.</p><p>A <strong>frameshift mutation</strong> is much more serious. Since codons are read in groups of 3, any LOSS of a single nucleotide would change the way all downstream letters are grouped into codons. This would shift the reading frame of all the codons and the sequence of amino acids in the chain would be dramatically altered. The same would happen if a letter were inserted into the sequence.</p><p><span class="lightbox-processed"><img alt="Thymine Dimer Formed by Ultraviolet Radiation" class="lightbox" height="293" src="http://courses.ed.science.psu.edu/bisc002/sites/courses/ed/bisc002/files/bisc002/images/ThymineDimer.jpg" style="margin: 10px;" title="Thymine Dimer Formed by Ultraviolet Radiation" width="458"></span></p><p>There are a number of causes of frameshift mutations. A common one happens when cells are exposed to UV rays from the sun. When a cell is hit with UV rays any sections of DNA that have a pair of T’s side by side will cause these nucleotides to bond to each other rather than to the pair of A’s on the opposite strand. This <strong>Thymine Dimer</strong> formation causes bumps in the DNA. Normally enzymes would break up these thymine dimers and restore the shape of the DNA strand. If however, too many of these form and the enzymes become overworked, other enzymes will come in and remove the dimer from the strand. This results in the loss of 2 letters in the sequence and gives a frameshift mutation.</p></div></div><p></p>
