<p>While natural selection dictates the frequency of specific <strong>alleles</strong> in a population, at some point enough changes may occur in a species that it no longer resembles the original organism. It is possible for sufficient changes in <strong>alleles</strong> to accumulate to the point where we talk about the formation of an entirely new species.</p><p><img alt="Squirrels from NYPL Digital Gallery Digital ID 823665" src="http://courses.ed.science.psu.edu/bisc002/sites/courses/ed/bisc002/files/bisc002/bisc002_evoless4_pic005.jpg" style="width: 527px; height: 357px;" title="Squirrels from NYPL Digital Gallery Digital ID 823665"></p><p>The formation of species follows certain rules that must be observed before an organism can be classified as a new species, separate from an ancestral form. As differences in <strong>genotype</strong> and <strong>phenotype</strong> begin to build up, organisms in the two different groups can no longer reproduce with each other. There are a variety of reasons for this, most commonly is geographical separation. For example, two groups of ground squirrels become separated over time by a large river that forms a gorge between them. The squirrels on the northern side of the canyon begin to take on coloration common to the rocks and ground around them. Squirrels on the southern side may begin to feed more on the berries in abundance there rather than the diet of nuts found on the other side of the canyon. If the two groups cannot move back and forth across the canyon over many, many years they will eventually become separate species.</p><p>Another cause for specialization may be the separated groups develop different colorations so that the females of the other group are not attracted to the males of both groups equally. Sometimes even mating behaviors can change so the females are not interested in males of the other group who behave strangely compared to the males of their normal group. Eventually biological factors will prevent fertilization between the two groups even if mating would take place. Once enough differences have accumulated the two groups are recognized as separate species.</p>
