Certainly it is impossible to conceive of humans manipulating the genes of living organisms for thousands of years. Still, that’s exactly what humans have done for millennia. Through <strong>selective breeding</strong> programs humans have brought about the creation of many new variants of animals and plants. Modern sweet corn is the result of centuries of breeding the Native American maize corn into something very&nbsp;different that we eat today.</p><p><img alt="dogs" src="http://courses.ed.science.psu.edu/bisc002/sites/courses/ed/bisc002/files/bisc002/dogs.jpg" style="width: 500px; height: 375px; margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px;"></p><p>Primitive humans progressed from hunters and gatherers to more advanced cultures through the domestication of plants and animals. With a more stable food supply humans were able to form more complex societies which gave rise to modern civilization. Humans initially used dogs for hunting or guarding the farm but eventually they gave rise to breeds kept just for show.</p><p><img alt="dogs2" src="http://courses.ed.science.psu.edu/bisc002/sites/courses/ed/bisc002/files/bisc002/dogs2.jpg" style="width: 500px; height: 333px;"><img alt="running horses" src="http://courses.ed.science.psu.edu/bisc002/sites/courses/ed/bisc002/files/bisc002/runninghorse.jpg" style="width: 500px; height: 357px; margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px;"></p><p>How organisms passed on traits to offspring was not known, understanding the mechanics of heredity did not come till later. Aristotle believed that inheritance was passed through the blood rather than through gametes as we understand it today. This is why some phrases like “blood relatives” or children being the “flesh and blood” of the parents are heard even today. Still, people knew that children looked like their parents and animals had offspring of the same species.</p><p>Through selective breeding humans were able to subtly change the characteristics of plants and animals over several generations into new variants. Some horses were raised for pulling the plow; others were adept at running very fast.</p><p><img alt="work horses" src="http://courses.ed.science.psu.edu/bisc002/sites/courses/ed/bisc002/files/bisc002/workhorses.jpg" style="width: 240px; height: 180px;"></p>
