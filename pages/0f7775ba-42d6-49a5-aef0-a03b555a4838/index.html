<p style="text-align: justify;">Another example of evolution in action is seen in the mutations of viruses like influenza. Some viruses are able to rapidly mutate their surface proteins from year to year while others are relatively stable over time. When a virus infects a host human, the immune system becomes engaged to destroy the virus. Also, once the immune system attacks a specific virus, the person is said to become immune to that specific virus. Immune system cells will forever after be on the lookout for that virus and will attack it much more effectively the second time around. In other words, the virus can't infect that same person twice.</p><p><img alt="Photograph from the Public Health Image Library, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention" src="http://courses.ed.science.psu.edu/bisc002/sites/courses/ed/bisc002/files/bisc002/bisc002_evoless3_pic022.gif" style="width: 286px; height: 252px;"></p><p style="text-align: justify;">If a virus just stopped at this point, it would eventually work its way through the whole human population and run out of places to live. It would cease to be able to reproduce and would go extinct. In order to prevent this, some viruses will have mutations in the proteins that make up their outer shell. These changes are not enough to alter the function of the virus but it will make the virus look slightly different to the immune system of a person. This "new" or slightly altered virus will be seen by the immune system as a completely different virus. The immune system will have to start over with a new virus; a person will not be immune to this new form. In this manner a virus can simply have alterations in the protein shell and find new hosts to keep on reproducing.</p>
