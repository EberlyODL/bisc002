<p>Now that we've seen the development of science during the Renaissance and beyond and we've discussed how science approaches the natural world, it is time to discuss the people that led Charles Darwin to his ideas about Evolution.</p>
<p>Up to the time of the early scientists described previously, few people were thinking about experiments that addressed the origins of life on Earth. People were only&nbsp;just beginning to accept new ideas about the planets and stars. The work of Copernicus, Galileo and Descartes were starting to sink in, but these new ideas were very troubling at least, and considered heresy at the worst.</p>
<p>Concepts about living organisms were every bit as entrenched as ideas about astronomy at the time. Nearly everyone believed in the creation of the planet as outlined in the biblical story, and no one thought that the Earth or the&nbsp;animals on it had changed one bit since creation. The very first idea people had to get used to was the idea that the Earth had even changed at all.</p>
