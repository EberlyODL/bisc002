<h2 class="art-postheader">(Carolus Linneaus)</h2>
<div class="art-postcontent"><div class="art-article"><p>Karl von Linnaeus was an avid naturalist. He spent his life collecting plant specimens in order categorize all of the living organisms he could find. He quite nearly single handedly created the science of Taxonomy or the ranking and classifying of&nbsp;living organisms. Over time, as others added to his collection he produced a multi-volume book that catalogued&nbsp;specimens from around the world. Linnaeus and another naturalist, John Ray, are credited with the development of classification systems that used a binomial naming system based on latin for all organisms. <em>Homo sapiens</em> is the correct scientific name for modern humans, and is an example of this system.</p>
<p>Karl Linnaeus was so enamored of his naming system he took to calling himself a Latinized form: Carolus Linnaeus. His main contribution to science involved creating an interest in the huge variety of plants and animals found in all corners of the Earth, which&nbsp;made him a very famous scientist in his day.</p></div></div>
