<p style="text-align: justify;">Sometimes selection pressures are not merely related to purely survival characteristics. Some traits are used strictly for attracting a mate to ensure reproduction. For example, male birds tend to be brightly colored, unlike females which are less colorful. Bright coloring on a male bird is more likely to attract both mates and predators.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><img alt="Photo by Sarah Roberts" src="http://courses.ed.science.psu.edu/bisc002/sites/courses/ed/bisc002/files/bisc002/cardinals.jpg" style="width: 431px; height: 311px;" title="Photo by Sarah Roberts"></p><p style="text-align: justify;">From a survival standpoint, a male cardinal is hardly camouflaged against predators yet is more likely to attract a mate. At least the male can fly away to avoid being eaten even if he does stand out more. The females on the other hand have to stay with the eggs on the nest so bright colors are definitely a problem.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">There are many other examples of physical characteristics or even behaviors that are used purely to attract a mate no matter how they would otherwise affect survival.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Male deer often display large antlers which they use to keep other males away from their territory (and mates). However large racks require extra nutrition to grow, larger muscles to manage and may actually hinder attempts to flee predators in thick forests. Still these males are more likely to mate and pass on these physical traits.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><img alt="Photo by Wes Marston" src="http://courses.ed.science.psu.edu/bisc002/sites/courses/ed/bisc002/files/bisc002/turkey2.jpg" style="width: 426px; height: 335px;" title="Photo by Wes Marston"></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Other examples include mating behavior to attract mates. Birdsong is used to attract a mate even though it could attract predators. The strutting behavior of wild turkeys is another example of a display designed to attract females.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">This sort of thing is even seen among humans. Will applying makeup and doing their hair make women any more likely to survive?What about the risk taking behavior of males? Some will drive fast cars or perform dangerous stunts in front of females in an attempt to gain attention. These activities make it less likely the male will survive to reproduce.</p>
