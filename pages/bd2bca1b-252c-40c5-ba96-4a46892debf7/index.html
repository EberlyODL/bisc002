<p>Abiotic pressures involve the organisms adapting to specific environments. Below are some examples.</p><h2>Temperature Tolerance?</h2><p>Living organisms can conduct basic metabolic processes under a particular temperature range.</p><ul><li>Brain cells are adapted to survive within a certain temperature range. If a person becomes sick and develops a fever, brain function will be impaired within a few degrees higher than normal. If the temperature rises even 10 degrees it can easily lead to death.</li><li>On the other hand, some bacteria will thrive at temperatures that would kill brain cells. These thermophilic bacteria are very well adapted to live in water that is nearly boiling! Other bacteria would find even room temperature too hot but will grow quite nicely in your refrigerator.</li></ul><h2>Eyesight</h2><p>Some organisms are adapted to operating in very different levels of light.</p><ul><li>The eyes of birds who hunt at night, like owls, are very different from the eyes used by hawks who hunt during the day.</li><li>Some organisms, like cave fish no longer require the use of their eyes at all. The eyes are still there but they don't work since they're not needed. These are called vestigial structures and are the result of natural selection at work in a place where no light is ever present. Eyes are only needed where there is light so in the dark there is no selective pressure for individuals who have good eyesight. Thus the fish can lose the structure altogether and it doesn't affect their survival.</li></ul><h2>Wings/Fins</h2><p>Other examples of abiotic adaptations are the development of wings or wing like structures that allow some animals to fly or even glide.</p><ul><li>Butterflies, birds, bats and even pterosaurs all have a wing structure that allows them to fly.</li><li>Animals in the oceans have fins and flippers that allow them to move effectively rather than arms and legs which would be less efficient.</li></ul><h2>Skin Pigmentation</h2><p>Skin pigmentation in humans gives another example of an adaptation to the environment. It's well known that visible differences between races of humans are seen in the variety of skin tone one sees in peoples from around the world. The skin tone of humans is related to the amount of sun their ancestors received based on local climate.</p><h2><span class="lightbox-processed" style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; padding-left: 0px; "><img alt="Skin Tones" class="lightbox" src="http://courses.ed.science.psu.edu/bisc002/sites/courses/ed/bisc002/files/bisc002/bisc002_evoless4_pic003.jpg" style="cursor: default; border-width: 0px; border-style: initial; border-color: initial; width: 324px; height: 267px;" title="Skin Tones"></span></h2><p>For example, peoples who live near the equator have a much darker skin tone than those living in northern climates. There is a correlation between sunlight exposure and skin tone. Melanin is produced to block the damaging effects of UV rays. Someone living near the equator in Africa needs to produce lots of melanin to reduce the chances of skin damage or skin cancer.</p><p>People living in more northern locations, like Scandinavia, receive less sunlight in a given year. Having dark skin is not necessary and is actually problematic. Sunlight is necessary for the body to produce vitamin D. Fair skin is advantageous in areas where there is little sunlight in a given year so one sees very few dark skinned people in northern climes. Light skin allows for the production of vitamin D and still protects well enough from the damaging effects of the sun. However, your friend with Swedish grandparents may be prone to sunburn on spring break as a result.</p>
