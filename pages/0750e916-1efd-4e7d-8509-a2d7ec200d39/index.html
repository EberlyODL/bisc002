<div class="art-postcontent"><div class="art-article"><p style="text-align: justify;">Thomas Malthus was a political economist who was concerned with the living conditions of the poor in England in the late 1800's. He had noted that many species of plants and animals produce far more offspring than will ultimately survive and he wondered how this could affect the living conditions of humans.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">He was mostly interested in advocating a limit to the size of families. He blamed the conditions of the poor on having too many children, being unable to provide resources for families and generally being lazy and irresponsible. The idea of limiting family size is still&nbsp;quite popular in places like China today.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Malthus' observation that populations have limits then influenced others to think about how that fact can affect a population that inherently possesses a wide&nbsp;variety of genetic differences (think back to meiosis!). If competition exists in a genetically diverse&nbsp;population then some individuals may be more suited to survival than others. In other words, since there is variation among individuals, some are more likely to survive to reproductive age better than others, and it will then be&nbsp;those survival traits that will be passed on to the next generation.</p></div></div>
