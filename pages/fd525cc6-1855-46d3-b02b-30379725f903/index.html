<p style="text-align: justify;">In recent decades, the teaching of evolution has come under fire. Seen as an attack on religion, evolution has itself come under attack as nothing more than a theory. Since it&#39;s just a theory then other, perhaps opposing, theories should also be taught. This has led to the development of something called Creation Science. This manifestation of creationism does not operate as a scientific discipline but rather consists of attacks on aspects of evolution theory. It represents a thinly disguised attempt to talk about biblical interpretations of human origins in a science class in school. When attempted, groups like the ACLU have sued school districts to prevent religious topics from being taught in science class. They cite the separation of church and state found in the Constitution as grounds for barring the teaching of religion in public schools.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Others have argues that this does not constitute a legitimate complaint. They note that interestingly the phrase "separation of church and state" is not found in the Constitution. It was a phrase Thomas Jefferson used when talking about the establishment clause that is found in the constitution. The establishment clause denies the government the ability to establish a state religion to which everyone must belong. The founding fathers had enough of that back in England and other countries in Europe. Here everyone was supposed to be free to practice any religion they chose. It wasn&#39;t meant to deny the practice of all religion so as to not seem biased toward any single religion. This issue is still hotly debated in communities all across the country every Christmas when anyone puts up a manger display or Christmas tree in the public square.</p>
