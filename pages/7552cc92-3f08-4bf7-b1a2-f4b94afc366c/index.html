<p>The biosphere is the sum collection of all the ecosystems on planet Earth. Ecology is sometimes called the science of the biosphere, which basically encompasses all earth sciences and all life sciences. The planet is made up of distinct geographical areas where certain kinds of plants and animals congregate in a particular type of climate. These large areas contain ecosystems called Biomes.</p><p>Biomes are fundamentally grouped into 3 categories. Terrestrial or land biomes include examples such as deserts, forests or grasslands. Freshwater biomes are another group and include lakes and rivers containing freshwater rather than saltwater. Marine biomes contain saltwater and include the oceans and seas.</p><p>Life is not distributed evenly across the planet but is rather sporadic. Some places are abundant in life, others are very much less so. The variations are mostly due to abiotic factors that influence the ability of life to survive in different regions. While there are a variety of ways to classify biomes, most methods take into account these abiotic factors:</p><ul><li>Sunlight</li><li>Water</li><li>Temperature</li><li>Wind</li><li>Soil</li></ul><div class="art-postcontent"><div class="art-article"><p><img alt="" src="http://courses.ed.science.psu.edu/bisc002/sites/courses/ed/bisc002/files/bisc002/biome.jpg" style="width: 500px; height: 375px;"></p></div></div><p></p>
