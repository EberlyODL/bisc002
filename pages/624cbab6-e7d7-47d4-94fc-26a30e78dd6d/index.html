<div class="art-postcontent"><div class="art-article"><p style="text-align: justify;">Eventually geologists were able to convince everyone that the surface of the Earth had in fact changed over time. Most of this was attributed to massive cataclysmic events such as the story of Noah and the flood. Even though such geologic changes were eventually accepted, this way of&nbsp;thinking about "perfectly created animals" did not have to change.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A geologist named Charles Lyell&nbsp;proposed that geologic changes had happened, and are still happening,&nbsp;very slowly due to volcanic activity, movement of&nbsp;glaciers and erosion of mountains by water. He was opposed to the supposition that cataclysmic events were solely responsible. The work of Lyell allowed others to begin to consider&nbsp;that the age of the earth was much older than anyone had considered at the time. He certainly believed that the Earth was more than the 6,000 years old claimed by supporters of Bishop Ussher.</p>
