<h2>RNA Transcription</h2><p>The process of Transcription is somewhat similar to the process of DNA replication in that the double stranded DNA is first separated by a Helicase. Then one of the two possible strands of DNA is copied by a polymerase enzyme. When complete, the DNA helix is restored after having copied a gene from the DNA molecule.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">There are a couple of important differences though. The enzyme used in Transcription to copy from the DNA is called <strong>RNA Polymerase</strong> since we are now making an RNA strand, not a DNA one. The RNA polymerase is making a single stranded copy of the DNA but it is making this single strand out of RNA. The resulting RNA strand is called a Messenger RNA or <strong>mRNA</strong>.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Another difference seen here is the introduction of a 5th base. When the RNA polymerase sees an A on the DNA strand it matches up a different nucleotide. Instead of the normal T that would be inserted the polymerase inserts a U (or uracil) nucleotide. There are no T’s in a messenger RNA strand, U’s are used instead.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><object align="left" classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0" height="500" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="600"><param name="quality" value="high"><param name="movie" value="/bisc002/sites/courses/ed/bisc002/files/bisc002/images/rnaTranscription.swf"><embed height="500" hspace="10" pluginspage="http://www.macromedia.com/go/getflashplayer" quality="high" src="http://courses.ed.science.psu.edu/bisc002/sites/courses/ed/bisc002/files/bisc002/images/rnaTranscription.swf" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" vspace="10" width="600"></object></p>
