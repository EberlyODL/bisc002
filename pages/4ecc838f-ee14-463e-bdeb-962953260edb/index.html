<p style="text-align: justify;">The permanent correction of a genetic condition has long been considered the holy grail of modern medicine. The entire pharmaceutical industry is built around the development of drugs that alter human physiology that is not functioning properly. We treat the symptoms but can't truly cure the disease. One can manage high blood pressure but can't make it vanish.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Gene therapy involves the insertion of genes that correct the function of mutated ones. Diabetes is a disease where something is wrong with the insulin protein and sugar metabolism cannot be controlled. If an intact, functional gene could be inserted into the cells of the body, each cell would produce the proper protein and the diabetes condition would disappear, permanently.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The trick is to get the proper gene into the proper cell. A vector is needed. In bacteria, a plasmid could be constructed and inserted into a cell. Eukaryotic cells will not function with a plasmid so another approach is needed.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Viruses function by attaching to host cells and inserting their genetic material. They then take over the host cell and use it to manufacture more viruses. If the viral DNA is removed and the proper human gene is inserted, the virus will then infect a target cell and deliver the functional gene.</p>
