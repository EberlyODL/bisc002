<p>If the explanation for the evolution of life is accurate, then the fossil record must provide evidence that life began as something simplistic and then slowly changed into more complex forms. It turns out that this is exactly what one sees in the history of the rock. Very old rocks contain fossils of very simple life forms, single celled organisms. Newer rocks contain more complex, multicellular organisms as fossil remains.</p>

<p>For example, in rocks dating back as far as 2.5 billion years ago, fossils of microscopic photosynthetic bacteria can be seen. These cyanobacteria, along with single celled eukaryotic cells were the predominant life form for a couple billion years, according to the fossil record.</p>

<p>Early cyanobacteria or blue green algae formed large mats or biofilms in the water along shorelines. Over time these mats built up, layer by layer, into structures called stromatolites. Over time minerals in the water precipitated till the stromatolites became fossilized rock structures. These cyanobacteria that formed stromatolites were important in the early production of oxygen. The ancient atmosphere did not contain much oxygen at first; the atmosphere then was very different from what exists today. This photo shows stromatolite formation in Shark Bay in Australia.</p>

<p>In all the rocks dated from then to about 600 million years ago, the only organisms present are single celled organisms. Starting in rocks dated 600 million years ago, we find the appearance of more complex, multicellular organisms. This was the Cambrian explosion of life recorded in the fossil record. Based on this evidence we find that life began as single celled organism that later evolved into multicellular organisms. These then progressively became larger and larger and eventually formed the plants and animals we know today.</p>
