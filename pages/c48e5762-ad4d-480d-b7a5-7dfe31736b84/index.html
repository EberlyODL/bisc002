<p style="text-align: justify;">A big part of the evidence for evolution comes from finding fossils that show a steady progression in the development of more recent organisms from much earlier different organisms. Being able to see a slow and steady progressive change in the structure of organisms over time in the fossil record helps support the idea that organisms today have evolved from ancestral forms in the past.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">When organisms make a big change from one form to another, having a series of fossils that show how this change took place is very valuable. However, fossils are difficult to find. Considering that the vast majority of organisms that ever lived on the planet no longer exist we have to piece together the story of evolution from bits and pieces of an incomplete fossil history. Still when it is possible, finding these transition organisms in the fossil record can really help support the concept of continuous evolution.</p>
