<p>In order for the process of evolution to work at all, it requires extremely long periods of time. Evolution works in very small increments over long periods of time, it is a slow and painstaking process. One problematic issue surrounding the process of evolution centers on dating the age of the earth itself. Even a couple of hundred years ago, everyone believed that the earth was just a few thousand years old. A few believed that the earth could be a couple million years old. Science has since found evidence to suggest that the earth is actually several billion years old.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It's possible to calculate the age of rocks and thus infer the age of the earth itself. Early geologists tried to calculate the amount of time necessary to form layers of sedimentary rock. Then they tried to estimate how long it would take a mountain to erode down to the level which they could see. Even based on those rough estimates early geologists came to realize the earth was at least hundreds of million years old.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">This image from Lake Mead NRA shows a sequence of sedimentary rock layers. The oldest layers, Cambrian (570-505 million years ago) are at the base, with younger layers piled on top. The older layers are lower 'relative' to the younger layers.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The best method by far of dating the age of rocks focuses on the decay of various radioactive materials that occur naturally in rock. A radioactive isotope will decay over time into a non radioactive element. The rate of this decay is entirely predictable. It's possible to measure the ratio of radioisotopes to normal atoms in a rock. These radioisotopes form when hot magma cools to form igneous rock. From that point on, the radioactive materials degrade into non radioactive atoms. The fewer radioisotopes found, the older the rock.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For this to work out well, one needs to have measurable levels of radioactive materials. Over millions or even billions of years the radioactive materials can degenerate to stable forms and the amount of radioactivity left could not be measured by instruments. However, some isotopes like potassium 40 have a half life of 1.25 billion years. That means that the amount of radioactive potassium 40 will be cut in half after a little over a billion years of decay. This particular radioisotope works well for dating very old rocks.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The oldest rocks are thought to be about 4.5 billion years old. It is difficult to find extremely old rocks since so much of the earths surface has been reshaped due to erosion, volcanic activity and the actions of plate tectonics. So far no one has found a rock older than this date. Even rocks from the moon were tested once retrieved by the Apollo astronauts. These rocks also date to around 4.5 billion years old. Cosmologists have long presumed that the moon and earth formed at the same time in geologic history. The dating of moon rocks seems to support this. Even meteorites have been dated to this same time frame. For all these reasons, scientists place the date of the formation of much of our solar system at between 4 and 5 billion years ago.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Other isotopes can be used but they may have a much shorter half life. Carbon dating is used to determine the ratio of regular carbon to radioactive carbon 14 in organic materials. The half life for carbon 14 is only 5730 years. Thus after about 50,000 years of decay the radioactive material is no longer detectible. Carbon dating is not of much use in determining the age of fossils. Still, even a 50,000 year timeframe is much older than what people believed before Darwin's time.</p>
