<div class="art-postcontent"><div class="art-article"><p>DNA is a double stranded molecule made up of chains of nucleotides. There are 4 nucleotides: A, T, C and G. Each strand is connected to the other by hydrogen bonds that link A to T and C to G. This double stranded structure then coils to form the Double Helix shape much like a spiral staircase.</p><p><span class="lightbox-processed"><img alt="DNA" class="lightbox" height="368" src="http://courses.ed.science.psu.edu/bisc002/sites/courses/ed/bisc002/files/bisc002/images/DNA.jpg" style="margin: 10px;" title="DNA" width="494"></span></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p></div></div><p></p>
