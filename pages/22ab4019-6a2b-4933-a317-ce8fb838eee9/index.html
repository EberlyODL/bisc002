<div class="art-postcontent"><div class="art-article"><p style="text-align: justify;">By the time of Copernicus, the study of astronomy had been going on for thousands of years. At the time he lived, an understanding of mathematics had developed to the point where astronomers felt they could predict the motions of the stars and planets. There was great interest in learning about astronomy, and the invention of the&nbsp;telescope allowed for careful observation.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Copernicus was very interested in how a Roman astronomer named Ptolemy described the movement of the stars in the sky. The Ptolemaic model placed the earth at the center of the universe while all the planets, including the sun, revolved around the earth. This was keeping in line with the belief at the time that humans were the most important part of creation so the universe is focused around&nbsp;the Earth, and us humans. Copernicus was not satisfied with this explanation in light of the fact that sometimes the planets did strange things, like move backwards from the predicted direction.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">After some work, Copernicus came up with a model that placed the sun at the center of the universe, and the Earth and planets revolve around it instead. Copernicus's idea was extremely revolutionary for it's time. This contradicted the "fact" that everyone knew that humans, and thus the Earth, was the center of all creation. Needless to say, he became a controversial figure even though he died soon after publishing his work.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The biggest contribution of Copernicus centers on his willingness to change the way people think about what "everyone knows". He led the way to a new way of thinking about the world, that the universe is very large and changing. This caused some concern at the time this began to change the way people thought of themselves and their relation to the universe.</p></div></div>
