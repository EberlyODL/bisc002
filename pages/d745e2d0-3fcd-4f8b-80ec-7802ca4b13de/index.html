<p style="font-size: 16px;">The rule of 10 also applies to environmental toxins, which can accumulate to high levels in organisms at the top of the food chain. Many toxins are present in the environment from industrial processes, spraying programs that wash material into streams, and even accidents.&nbsp;If a toxin that cannot be removed from the body is present in plant life, the primary consumers will ingest the plants and the toxins along with it.</p>
<p style="font-size: 16px;">Since only 10% of the energy is captured in a food pyramid, that means the primary consumer has to eat 10X the amount of plant matter to get the required energy level. That means the organism will eat 10X the amount of toxin normally found in any given plant. Now, once a predator goes through the same process and eats a bunch of herbivores, it will accumulate high levels of the toxin into its system.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="font-size: 16px;"><br>This accumulation of a toxin in a food chain is known as biomagnification. As each organism higher on the food chain eats more and more organisms lower on the food chain, the toxin will "magnify" in the sequence until the top feeders have high levels in their systems.</p>
<p style="font-size: 16px;">The classic example of this is the story of DDT. This insecticide was widely used beginning in WWII as a means of controlling mosquito-borne illnesses in many of the tropical environments where the military had to fight. At first this was seen as a huge advance in the fight against diseases like malaria and yellow fever that routinely kill millions every year. DDT was also useful for destroying insects that damage crops, and it helped save millions more from starvation. It was the cheapest and most effective insecticide of its day. At one time it was one of the most effective insecticides used on cotton crops. Up to 80% of all DDT sprayed in the 50's was used on cotton crops alone. The inventor of the stuff, Paul Muller of Switzerland, even won the Nobel Prize!</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px;">These pictures show some of the common methods of application of DDT in past decades. High volume spraying of insecticides was also used in Louisiana following the Katrina disaster.</p>
<p style="font-size: 16px;">However, in the 50's and 60's, there was a sharp decline in the numbers of several large raptor species, among others, particularly those who eat a diet of fish. The populations of bald eagles, cormorants, ospreys, Peregrine falcons, and even brown pelicans declined. Three in particular, the bald eagle, brown pelican, and osprey, nearly went extinct. The culprit was found to be DDT.</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px;">The insecticide DDT cannot be metabolized by the liver--it remains in the body. It tends to accumulate in fat tissues, so it's not easily removed from the bloodstream by the kidneys. It is nearly impossible to rinse away in the environment--it just stays where it's sprayed. When the concentration of DDT builds up in an animal, it disrupts nerve conduction and the animal dies of convulsions or paralysis. In lower doses, it was also linked to a thinning of the egg shells of birds. Thus bird mortality rates went way up.</p>
<p style="font-size: 16px;">DDT also has effects on many organisms in the environment. There has been a link to breast cancer, but more research is needed. Still, though many different species are affected by DDT, it's normally only the predators at the end of a food chain that have enough of the chemical concentrated in their systems for it to be fatal.</p>
<p style="font-size: 16px;">Today, DDT is banned for use in the United States and most European countries. It is, however, still MADE in the US and sold for use worldwide.</p>
