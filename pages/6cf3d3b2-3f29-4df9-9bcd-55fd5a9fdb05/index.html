<p>The term disease can be defined as an impairment of health or a condition of abnormal functioning. Diseases are often found as a combination of different factors. These can include:</p><ul type="disc"><li>Inherited/Genetic factors</li><li>Environmental factors</li><li>Microbial infections</li></ul><p>In many cases there can be several things going on at once. Infectious diseases like a cold are attributable to an invading microbe like the cold virus. Anthrax is caused by infection with the spores of a specific bacterium. However, cold viruses are most commonly spread during dry winter months. Is that an environmental factor? Why do some people get sick easier than others, is there a genetic component of health?</p><p>Sometimes there is a single cause for a particular disease. Cystic Fibrosis is caused by a single DNA mutation that is inherited. It's not something you can catch or get from living in a cold climate. Sickle cell anemia is another inherited disease. However, some forms of diabetes are directly inherited while other become diabetics due to being overweight and having a poor diet</p><p>A disease like cancer can have multiple causes. Some rare forms of cancer are inherited. Other cancers are caused by the environment, for example, chronic smoking and lung cancer. Another form of cancer, cervical cancer has been associated with certain types of STD infections. While the cause of any specific disease can have many components weâ€™ll look at some diseases with a strict genetic component.</p>
