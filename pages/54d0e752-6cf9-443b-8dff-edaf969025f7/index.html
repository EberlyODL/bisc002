<p style="text-align: justify;">Humans have for a long time sought to explain the workings of the natural world around them. Humans began as hunters and gatherers and slowly learned to work together in larger groups to make life just a little bit easier for the group as a whole. Eventually humans domesticated animals rather than just hunting&nbsp;them, and used animals to help produce food. The rise of agriculture allowed people to have enough food on hand without the need to spend every hour of every day working just to survive. Eventually people began to live in villages and&nbsp;towns.&nbsp;Individuals learned new skills and built new tools. In time, full blown civilization was well underway.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Throughout many ancient civilizations, some individuals were able to focus on tasks not strictly devoted to mere survival. Every society had individuals that knew about how to do things or about the world around them. In those days all knowledge and understanding was passed down in an oral tradition. Eventually, writing was invented to facilitate the accumulation of knowledge of the natural world. The ancient Egyptians for example made substantial strides in astronomy, medicine and especially mathematics. A thorough understanding of geometry was needed for the ancient Greeks and Egyptians to be able to build their temples and pyramids. The ancient Greeks placed much less emphasis on supernatural explanations for natural events but their explanations for such events seem to be invented out of thin air.</p></div></div>
