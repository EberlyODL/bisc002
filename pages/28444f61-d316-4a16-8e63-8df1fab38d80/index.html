<p class="art-postheader">The process of meiosis ends with the production of a haploid or N gamete cell. In a human, that cell will have exactly 23 chromosomes. Sometimes however, the process of meiosis does not result in the exact number of chromosomes needed. Sometimes there are extra chromosomes present. In the rare case when the chromosomes are not split up among the gametes evenly, it is due to <strong>Non-disjunction</strong> of the chromosomes.</p>

<p>If such an abnormal gamete is used for fertilization, the resulting zygote will have too many chromosomes. Most of the time such an embryo will not develop at all. If however, the extra chromosome is one of the smaller ones (fewer genes involved) it&rsquo;s possible to have development proceed leading to a birth. Such a baby will inevitably have significant problems.</p>
<p>Since chromosomes are visible under a microscope, there is a simple test to check to see if a developing fetus has the proper number of chromosomes. A tissue sample is needed and the cells can be viewed. A snapshot of one cell showing the chromosomes allows a technician to arrange and count the chromosomes. This is called a <strong>Karyotype</strong>. The image above shows the sample cell has 47, rather than the normal 46 chromosomes. Note that for the #21 chromosome there are 3 visible rather than the 2 found in a normal diploid cell. This condition, known as Trisomy 21 is the cause of <strong>Down&rsquo;s syndrome</strong>.</p>
<p>While non-disjunction can happen to any gamete undergoing meiosis, this problem is more common with the egg cells produced by females. Males produce gamete cells beginning at puberty, on a continuous basis. In females, the first phase of meiosis occurs before the female baby is even born. These female gametes are then frozen partway through meiosis until puberty. Then, once a month, a single egg cell completes meiosis and is released from the ovary.</p>

<p>While sperm gametes are made on a daily basis, female egg gametes are stored sometimes for years before they are used. It is because of the long term storage that several decades later, when a cell completes meiosis things can go wrong. Non-disjunction is more likely to happen in older egg cells. Thus these sorts of birth defects are tied to the age of the mother, not necessarily the age of the father. The chart shows how very young mothers and women in their 40&rsquo;s and 50&rsquo;s are most likely to have children with an incorrect chromosome number.</p>
