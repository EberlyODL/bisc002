<p>The ancient Egyptians, Greeks and later, the&nbsp;Romans all made contributions to science in their day but many of their beliefs were still rooted in the supernatural world. All of these cultures had the&nbsp;religious tradition of praying to many gods, each of whom were supposed to deal with a specific human concern. There were gods for healing, fertility, harvest and success in war. Naturally many of their understandings of the natural world were attributed to the actions of one or more of the Gods. For example, the sun traversed the sky each day on Apollo's chariot.</p>
<p>More modern scientific views were first developed during the Renaissance period of European history. During this time it became possible to begin to build sophisticated tools that allowed for the study of objects that were poorly understood at the time. Technology had advanced enough to create devices like telescopes and even microscopes to look at things that were&nbsp;either really far away or very, very small. Without being able to see an object clearly, it's no wonder that the ancient Romans and Greeks relied on supernatural explanations for natural events.</p>
<p>So, a certain level of technology had to be developed and new philosophies about the natural world came to light during the Renaissance. People were now asking questions about nature, rather than merely accepting the views that had existed up until&nbsp;that time. As a result, a long string of visionaries came along and each contributed something to the development of modern science. The following is a brief listing of these scientists and the contributions they made&nbsp;to the development of modern science.</p>
