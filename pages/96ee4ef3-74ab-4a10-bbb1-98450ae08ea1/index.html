<div class="swftools-wrapper swftools-swf">Working with plants is an obvious application of genetic engineering. Producing sufficient food for an ever growing world population continues to be an ongoing struggle. Using gene transfer techniques it is possible to create new varieties of plants to help meet this challenge.</div>
<p>So what can plants get in this manner? Plants can be given resistance to drought, insects, and herbicides. A company called Monsanto makes a soy bean that is very resistant to RoundUp, which is used to kill weeds. We can make more nutritious plants that contain extra vitamins like Vitamin A in golden rice. It's possible to increase the amount of produce made by each plant. The microbe Bacillus thuringiensis produces a toxin (Bt toxin) that kills insects. It has been long used as a spray on fields to kill crop destroying insects, and now it's possible to insert the gene into a corn plant so any insect eating it will die, so no more spraying of fields required.</p>
<p>There is much research into developing new plants that are easier to grow for a farmer, particularly those in poor countries where famine is a real problem and modern farming practices are rare. Rather than shipping grain to a nation facing drought, a better idea would be to provide seeds of plants that can grow in harsh conditions. These are all goals of plant engineering.</p>
<p>The process for inserting desired genes into plants involves using a bacterium ready made for such a task. We can again turn to nature to find a vector delivery system for plants. There is a bacterium called Agrobacterium tumefaciens has a plasmid that naturally inserts DNA into a plant cell. This organism causes plant tumors and is considered a big problem in agriculture. The plasmid can be harnessed to deliver a target gene to plant tissues.</p>
<p>In this case we build a vector using this natural bacterial system. All we have to do is insert a gene of interest into the plasmid using the exact procedure as outlined previously. Then it's just a matter of growing the plant cells into a mature plant that will now contain our gene of interest. The following animation shows the general process.</p>
