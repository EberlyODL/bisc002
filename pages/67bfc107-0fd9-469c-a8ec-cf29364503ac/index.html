<div class="art-postcontent"><div class="art-article"><p>One cause of point mutations come from chemicals called base analogs. These are chemicals that look like one of the 4 base nucleotides and can be inserted into DNA during replication. Unfortunately when a DNA polymerase attempts to later use the DNA in a new round of replication the base analogs confuse it. The DNA polymerase which is normally very good at matching up the letter correctly starts to make mistakes. The polymerase may insert any of the 4 bases since it canâ€™t decide what the base analog is supposed to code.</p><p><span class="lightbox-processed"><img alt="DNA Mutation in HIV Virus" class="lightbox" height="311" src="http://courses.ed.science.psu.edu/bisc002/sites/courses/ed/bisc002/files/bisc002/images/HIVMutation.jpg" style="margin: 10px;" title="DNA Mutation in HIV Virus" width="362"></span></p><p>AZT is a drug once used to treat AIDS. The idea was to cause as many mutations as possible in the HIV pathogen to hopefully kill it. Unfortunately AZT also gets incorporated into the DNA of healthy cells and kills them too. The drug has pretty toxic effects and now much better drugs are available to treat AIDS.</p></div></div><p></p>
