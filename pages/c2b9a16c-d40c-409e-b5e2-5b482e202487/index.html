<p>The total number of chromosomes a cell has varies by the species of the organism. Some species have more chromosomes than others. That does not mean an organism with more chromosomes has more genes however. Chimpanzees and potatoes both have 48 chromosomes but the chimpanzee has more genes. It&rsquo;s just that the potato has its genome broken up into smaller parts. The chromosomes are a bit smaller.</p>
