<p>The first cells that form after the Zygote have the ability to develop into many other types of tissues: they are totipotent. These cells are also part of a large controversy because they are very useful in <strong>Stem Cell Research</strong>. A stem cell can specialize into a wide variety of cells if the body needs to replace a damaged or dead cell. Since these cells can develop into many other types of tissues they can be used to repair damaged tissues in adults.</p><p>Nerve tissue does not easily repair itself after being damaged. In fact most nerve tissue cannot repair itself at all. As a result, an injury to the brain for example, is permanent. However, fetal cells have been shown to develop into new nerve tissue under the right conditions. This is a tremendous hope to people who have injuries or diseases that have destroyed nerve cells. Some experiments have also shown stem cells capable of forming new muscle cells in the heart to replace cells damaged during a heart attack. The possibilities are virtually endless for curing a wide variety of human diseases.</p><p>Still, there is much controversy surrounding the use of fetal stem cells. Much of it comes from the fact that embryos are needed to supply the totipotent cells. Typically the embryo is disassembled and the cells separated so they can be used for the medical treatment. This means the embryo will not develop into a new individual organism. Many people find that objectionable.</p>
