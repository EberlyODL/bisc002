<p>A human has 23 different pairs of chromosomes. Numbers 1 through 22 will contain the same genes on each homologous pair. So, both of the #1 chromosomes will contain the exact same genes even though there may be different allele combinations at work. The last pair of chromosomes, #23 is different from all the others. These are the sex chromosomes. The combination of X and Y chromosomes determines the sex of the individual.</p>
<p>Females have two identical chromosomes, the X chromosome so females are always XX. Males also have the X chromosome because it contains genes that are absolutely necessary for life. However, males only have one such chromosome. The other chromosome is the Y chromosome. While there are no vital genes on the Y chromosome the genes for &lsquo;maleness&rsquo; reside there. This triggers the fetal development into a male.</p>
<p>When gamete cells form, each one contains a single sex chromosome. All egg gametes must contain an X chromosome. All females have two X chromosomes so there is no other possibility. Sperm cells on the other hand could have either X or Y chromosomes. Apparently all moms are wired to have baby girls. Dads are the ones who determine if it&rsquo;s a baby boy or a baby girl. It just depends on which sperm cell fertilizes the egg.</p>
