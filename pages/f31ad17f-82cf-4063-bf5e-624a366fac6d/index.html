<div class="art-postcontent"><div class="art-article"><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Divergent Evolution</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Divergent evolution describes how a common form can become slightly modified over time into several new forms. For example the forelimb of many vertebrates has the same general set of bones in it, yet the bones themselves have changed shape over time to allow very different uses of the forelimb.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The same bones are present in humans or four legged creatures as well as in a whale or bird and bats wing. The bones though are in very different shapes to support the structure of an arm, leg or wing.</p><h4><img alt="" src="http://courses.ed.science.psu.edu/bisc002/sites/courses/ed/bisc002/files/bisc002/divergentevolution.png" style="width: 550px; height: 400px;" title=""></h4><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Convergent Evolution</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Convergent evolution is somewhat different. Sometimes different species will develop similar traits that allow them adapt to a unique environmental condition. These evolutionary adaptations happen in very different species that do not have a recent common ancestor. For example, the sleek body shapes of dolphins and sharks allow them to move quickly through the water. However, dolphins are mammals and sharks are fish. Both are very distant on the evolutionary tree yet they deal with moving through the water with a similar sleek body design.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Convergence is a powerful argument supporting natural selection. In this instance, very different organisms evolve very similar methods for dealing with a common way of moving or finding food. Organisms have a tendency to evolve in the same ways in unrelated lineages. Birds and bats and insects all have wing structures developed for flight. These organisms did not have a common ancestor. Thus the fact that these organisms each independently evolved the ability to fly suggests that doing so have an evolutionary advantage. Otherwise they could have evolved strong legs like many other organisms.</p></div></div><p></p><p><script type="text/javascript" src="https://content.bitsontherun.com/players/XLM7wu1K-2pHRl6he.js"></script></p>
