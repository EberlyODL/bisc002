<p>The fossil record is full of examples of slow change in particular organisms over time. The evolution of a horse leg structure is a common example. Ancient horse like creatures had a food with several toes. Over time the structure of the toes changed. The weight of the animal became centered on one of the center toes rather than spread equally out among all of them. With less surface area the animals were able to run long distances at high speeds. The central toe became encased in a hard material to resist abrasion The toes to either side, which were no longer needed, became reduced in size until they disappeared altogether.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><script src="https://content.bitsontherun.com/players/i3FmIX0D-2pHRl6he.js" type="text/javascript">
