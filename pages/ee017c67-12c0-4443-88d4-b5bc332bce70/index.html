<p>The process of Natural Selection is based on four concrete facts.</p>
<h3>Fact #1: Most species produce more offspring than are necessary to maintain a stable population.</h3>
<p>Nature has decided that it's desirable to produce more offspring than at first glance would appear to be necessary. The assumption is that some of the offspring will not survive to reproduce; therefore many offspring are needed to ensure that at least a few will reproduce and continue the population. For example, frogs and fish lay dozens or hundreds of eggs. Even humans could theoretically produce a couple dozen children over active childbearing years.</p>
<p>The more likely it is that&nbsp;an individual will die as a result of predation, disease or starvation typically means that individual of that species&nbsp;will produce more&nbsp;offspring. Sometimes this also depends on how much care is shown for the offspring. Obviously humans dedicate a lot of time to&nbsp;the care and protection of their young. Compare this to a&nbsp;salmon, for example,&nbsp;who will spawn thousands of eggs at a time but none of the offspring are looked after. In either case, the POTENTIAL to produce offspring far outweighs&nbsp;the need to&nbsp;add&nbsp;to the population.</p>
<h3>Fact #2: Natural resources are limited.</h3>
<p>This idea was put forth by Thomas Malthus in his essays on Principle of Populations.</p>
<p>Because natural resources are limited, there is a basic competition for resources (food, space and mates) among individuals, so not all individuals in a species will survive long enough to mate and produce offspring. This is a major factor in the explanation of why species tend to produce more offspring than would appear necessary.</p>
<p>This concept has given rise to one of the most misunderstood idea of evolution, the so called "survival of the fittest".</p>
<h3>Fact #3: Individuals within a species will vary in a number of physical characteristics.</h3>
<p>Some individuals in a population are faster, stronger, more camouflaged, better equipped to find food, more likely to attract a mate, etc. than others. Since variations exist, these variations are what determine which individual will survive in a population to reproduce.</p>
<h3>Fact #4: The variations seen among individuals are the result of different alleles in a population. These traits can thus be passed onto offspring.</h3>
<p>Variations among individuals have been thoroughly explained by the study of genetics. Individuals have two copies of all genes and it is the interaction of different forms or alleles of these genes that gives rise to&nbsp;a particular phenotype. These phenotypes then determine which individual will be best suited to survival in a given situation or environment.</p>
<p>The overall implication in this is that the ultimate survivability of an individual is correlated to genetic fitness. We say some traits allow an organism to "fit" into a given environment better than other traits. If a trait gives the individual an ability to survive better than other members of the species then it will more likely pass on that trait than other individuals who are less likely to survive. Ultimately, the game of evolution is to live long enough to reproduce.</p>
