<h3><strong>(aka Incomplete Dominance)</strong></h3>
<p>A different type of allele interaction involves a blending of the traits of each allele. Rather than having a dominant allele that masks the recessive one, in Semi Dominance or Incomplete Dominance the heterozygous combination give a third phenotype.</p>
<p>For example, in a flower, the petal color may have red as the dominant trait and white as the recessive trait. Normally a heterozygous plant (Aa) would have the recessive trait masked. Instead, in this case, the heterozygous gives a new phenotype, the flower is pink, a mixing of the red and white pigments.</p>
<p>Another example could be dark red and pale cherries. The dark color and the pale color would be seen in the homozygous phenotypes. However a heterozygous plant would produce pink cherries, a true blend of the dark and pale colors.</p>
