<div class="art-postcontent"><div class="art-article"><p>Malaria is an infectious disease caused by the infection of blood cells with a parasite carried by mosquitoes. Someone who is heterozygous or carries the Sickle cell trait, produces both proper and improper hemoglobin. As noted, such an individual does NOT have the symptoms of sickle cell anemia.</p><p><span class="lightbox-processed"><img alt="" class="lightbox" height="475" src="http://courses.ed.science.psu.edu/bisc002/sites/courses/ed/bisc002/files/bisc002/images/Malaria.jpg" title="" width="635"></span></p><p>It turns out that individuals who are heterozygous do not experience the same level of illness when infected with malaria as those who do not carry the trait. Having one copy of the defective gene and producing some sickle cells is protective against the malaria parasite. In other words, heterozygotes survive malaria better than those who are homozygous dominant. This is sometimes referred to as the heterozygote advantage.</p><p>In an environment where malaria readily kills healthy individuals, those who have the trait are more likely to survive to pass the trait onto offspring. Those who are homozygous dominant die easily of malaria, those who are homozygous recessive die of the sickle cell disease itself. Natural Selection tends to increase the population of carriers over those who do not carry the trait. This will be discussed in more detail in the evolution section of the course.</p></div></div><p></p>
