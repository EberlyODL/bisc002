<p style="text-align: justify;">When a change in the letter sequence of DNA or RNA occurs it is called a mutation. There are many chemical and physical causes of mutation. Many naturally occurring and manmade chemicals can cause mutations. Radiation of various kinds can cause mutation. Whatever the cause, changes in the nucleotide sequence can dramatically impact the coding of a protein. As can be seen in the genetic code, changing nucleotides can change the amino acid inserted, possibly with dramatic consequences.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span class="lightbox-processed"><img alt="Code of Life" class="lightbox" height="456" src="http://courses.ed.science.psu.edu/bisc002/sites/courses/ed/bisc002/files/bisc002/images/CodeofLife.jpg" style="margin: 10px;" title="Code of Life" width="442"></span></p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Point mutations</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">A common form of a mutation involves the switching of a single letter in the DNA sequence to another letter. Sometimes DNA and RNA polymerases make mistakes when matching letters and use the wrong pairing pattern. While a T should pair with an A, sometimes a C or G is inserted instead. This is called a point mutation and they have wide ranging effects.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span class="lightbox-processed"><img alt="Point Mutations" class="lightbox" height="390" src="http://courses.ed.science.psu.edu/bisc002/sites/courses/ed/bisc002/files/bisc002/images/PointMutations.jpg" style="margin: 10px;" title="Point Mutations" width="610"></span></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Depending on which letter of a 3 letter codon is altered, different changes can happen. Since the genetic code is redundant, changing a specific codon to a different codon that calls for the insertion of the same amino acid won’t change the end protein one bit. This is a <strong>Neutral mutation</strong>. If the change in one codon to another ends with a change in the amino acid used, this is called a <strong>Missense mutation</strong>. The last and most serious point mutation is a <strong>Nonsense mutation</strong>. Here a codon that codes for a given amino acid is changed into a stop codon. Depending on where this happens along the chain, a premature stop codon can terminate a protein before it’s half completed. Such a protein is highly unlikely to function properly.</p>
