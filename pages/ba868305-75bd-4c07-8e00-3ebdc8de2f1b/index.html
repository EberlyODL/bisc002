<p>During Meiosis a unique accident can occur due to the way the chromosomes are lined up before division. Since the chromosomes pairs are lined up side by side and separated it is possible for pieces of the chromosomes to switch with each other in a process called crossing over.</p><p><span class="lightbox-processed"><img alt="Cross Over" class="lightbox" src="http://courses.ed.science.psu.edu/bisc002/sites/courses/ed/bisc002/files/bisc002/crossover.jpg" style="width: 397px; height: 372px;" title="Cross Over"></span></p><p>Since the chromosomes are identical they can switch parts without changing the number of genes on the new chromosome combinations. However, there may be a mixing of alleles during this process that contributes to the variety of the resulting gametes that are produced. The newly recombinant chromatids contain the same genes but the alleles can be different.</p><p><br>&nbsp;</p>
