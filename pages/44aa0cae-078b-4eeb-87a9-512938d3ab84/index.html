<p class="art-postheader">Darwin was well versed in the ideas of the day regarding the origins of living organisms. He was very familiar with Lamarck's explanations of a possible mechanism for evolution, and he also had read Charles Lyell's book on Geology. This latter book was to have a profound impact on his own ideas. Here was a person advocating the view that since geological processes are very slow, the Earth must be older than anyone had ever thought.</p>

<p>Since Darwin had voyaged to places where he could see the actions of geological events like volcanoes and earthquakes first hand he became convinced that Lyell's ideas were correct. He wondered that if geological processes can make changes very slowly over time, perhaps slow changes in living organism of long periods of time could change them as well.</p>
<p>Fittingly, it took Darwin many years after his return from the trip around the world to work out a suitable presentation for his ideas. He spent most of his time back from the voyage in England writing about the specimens he saw or collected, and worked on his book the Voyage of the Beagle. His intention was to be well thought of as a world traveler and expert on natural history.</p></div></div>
