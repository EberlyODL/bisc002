<p>Naturalism is a philosophy that attempts to describe events in the world as having a physical or natural cause. The antithesis of this is supernaturalism, whereby events in the world are caused by a supernatural or nonphysical cause. Science takes the approach of Methodological Naturalism, founded on the idea that all events are based on natural causes. This approach is taken for the purposes of promoting the successful investigation into events occurring in the world around us.</p>
<p>If one uses this approach then it's possible to study how bacteria cause disease in humans, for example. If we investigate the "germ theory of disease", we may find that naturally occurring antibiotics can be used to cure someone of an illness. If on the other hand we know that all disease is caused by demons which are not controllable in the natural world, it becomes irrelevant to learn about the bacteria and hope to find drugs to cure the illness.</p>
<p>Of course science would never be able to prove or disprove the existence of demons and their impact on human health. The point being that science would not undertake such an investigation, it does not have the tools required. Studying the natural world precludes conclusions about the supernatural world; the two cannot be approached in the same way. Thus science never tries to make claims about the existence, one way or the other, of supernatural phenomenon.</p>
