<div class="art-postcontent"><div class="art-article"><p style="text-align: justify;">An English philosopher, Francis Bacon is credited with the development of modern experimental science. Bacon wrote that a number of factors, or idols as he called them, led to errors in the logical reasoning of humans. That these human "fixations" alter the way one perceives everything around them.</p>
<ol><li style="text-align: justify;">The first idol deals with the tendency of humans to make things more simplistic than they really are. Humans tend to exaggerate or distort events or use them to draw conclusions that are not accurate.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">The second&nbsp;idol centers on the thoughts of an individual being influenced by their own experiences or background. Personal tastes are not a basis for all knowledge.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">A third failing Bacon described, is the failings of an imprecise language. People use the same words but they may have very different meanings. This often introduces confusion into a discussion of some natural phenomena.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">The last idol deals with how humans use past knowledge or philosophies even though they may be grossly inaccurate. This addressed why some people held on&nbsp;to old beliefs, like the Earth being at&nbsp;the center of the universe, even in the face of new understanding. It's just easier for some to cling to what's familiar, rather than embrace a new idea.</li></ol>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Because of these failings in human thinking that Bacon described, he promoted a new way of viewing the world. He suggested that everyone should use inductive reasoning. Inductive reasoning begins when one makes many observations and only then proceeds to make a more general statement about the observed phenomenon. One should start with a collection of observations before coming&nbsp;up with an explanation that fits the facts available. This is the foundation for scientific research. Bacon also talked about forming communities of people who think in this more logical pattern who can then share ideas. Science is based on a community of ideas, where all share and test each other's ideas.</p></div></div>
