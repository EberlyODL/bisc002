<p>The life cycle of a cell is not entirely composed of cell division. A cell can either be in the process of dividing, preparing for division or merely going about their normal business. When cells are going through division they are in the <strong>M phase</strong> or <strong>Mitotic phase</strong>. The rest of the time they are in a period of time called <strong>Interphase</strong>.</p><p><img alt="" height="399" src="http://courses.ed.science.psu.edu/bisc002/sites/courses/ed/bisc002/files/bisc002/cellcycle.jpg" width="390"></p><p>This period in between divisions is broken down into several parts. The <strong>G1 phase</strong> is the part of the life cycle where the cell is performing its normal function. At some point the cell is triggered to begin preparing for the process of cellular division. The first step is DNA replication where all the chromosomes are copied in the <strong>S or synthesis phase</strong>. In the <strong>G2 phase</strong>, the cell prepares any cellular machinery needed during the actual cell division process called Mitosis.</p>
