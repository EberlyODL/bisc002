<div class="art-postcontent"><div class="art-article"><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Localized distribution</strong> refers to a species being found in a very restricted area without the ability to leave a current location. If anything were to happen in that local vicinity, say a volcanic eruption, all member of the species would be wiped out in short order. Sometimes small animal or insect populations die out in this manner.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Overspecialization</strong> describes a species that has become dependant on a very narrowly defined set of environmental conditions. An insect for example may come to rely on a specific plant for food. If that plant were to die out for any reason, the insect itself would have nothing else to eat for food. It's become so dependant on a single food source that it could not survive the loss of that other species. The extinction of the dodo bird caused problems for certain plants because the plants relied on the bird species to assist in the spread of seeds.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Reduced genetic variability</strong> is another condition that can threaten the survivability of a species. Many animals in a variety of species have been lost via reduced habitat or hunting by humans. Even when the remnants of these species become protected by law or their numbers are increased by breeding programs, the gene pool has been reduced to the point where the species survival is threatened. The continuous inbreeding of the remaining members of the species can cause a number of genetic problems. The species as a whole is no longer healthy. For example, pandas are nearly extinct even though many are furiously trying to increase their numbers through breeding programs.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Environmental Changes</strong> clearly cause conditions that may lead to the extinction of species. There are a number of types of environmental changes that cause extinctions.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span class="lightbox-processed"><img alt="Habitat Loss" class="lightbox" src="http://courses.ed.science.psu.edu/bisc002/sites/courses/ed/bisc002/files/bisc002/bisc002_evoles5_pic004.jpg" style="width: 180px; height: 250px; margin: 10px;" title="Habitat Loss"></span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Habitat loss</strong> is caused by the loss or even fragmentation of the habitat of a species. If habitat is broken up into smaller, unconnected parcels, there may not be enough space to accommodate a genetically diverse population. Habitat fragmentation caused by human housing tends to increase the numbers of predators that the land can support. Since predators can also feed on garbage generated by humans they tend to be attracted to fragmented areas. The other species then have a harder time moving and finding good habitat in fragmented areas plus they have to deal with increased numbers of predators. Not to mention the fact that humans may intentionally or accidentally kill these same species. It's not uncommon to see roadkill where housing developments encroach on wildlife areas.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span class="lightbox-processed"><img alt="Lamprey attached to a fish" class="lightbox" src="http://courses.ed.science.psu.edu/bisc002/sites/courses/ed/bisc002/files/bisc002/bisc002_evoles5_pic006.jpg" style="width: 300px; height: 190px; margin: 10px;" title="Lamprey attached to a fish"></span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Environmental contamination </strong>is a problem for many species.Some animals can have contaminants accumulate in their bodies as they eat other animals that are contaminated. The larger the animal, the more it has to eat on average and the more toxins that it will accumulate. This phenomenon is called biomagnification. An example is the mercury found in fish. While mercury occurs naturally in the environment, much of the mercury found in waters comes from air pollution that mixes into large bodies of water. Small fish feed and take mercury into their system. This mercury is not rapidly metabolized so it builds up in body tissues. Then bigger fish eat lots of the smaller ones and thus take all that mercury into their system.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Humans eat fish as a healthy part of our diet. The problem is that mercury causes development problems in young children and in pregnant women. These people need to monitor their intake of certain kinds of fish. They should not eat large, long lived fish like shark, swordfish and king mackerel. Even albacore tuna has higher levels of mercury than other tuna. Tuna steak has more than regular canned tuna. It may take a year for levels of mercury to drop significantly so eating a single serving a week of such fish is suggested by the FDA.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Other forms of environmental contamination can lead to the sudden growth of one species at the expense of others. This rapid change in population ratios can easily lead to widespread death. Under certain conditions red tide or algal blooms can form in coastal waters. Red tide is a term used to describe the massive growth of phytoplankton in coastal waters. Some types of phytoplankton contain pigments that actually turn the water brown or reddish in color. These organisms can kill fish and shellfish due to the production of toxins the phytoplankton release into the water. Shellfish can become so contaminated that they are inedible by humans.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The causes of red tide vary but one cause is the release of fertilizer into a river or coastal bay where the currents do not allow for the dilution of the nitrates and phosphates. Runoff from agricultural areas flows to the ocean where it's dumped into a coastal area. The rich nutrients promote the growth of huge numbers of these phytoplankton organisms which then disrupt other marine species.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span class="lightbox-processed"><img alt="Zebra Mussels" class="lightbox" src="http://courses.ed.science.psu.edu/bisc002/sites/courses/ed/bisc002/files/bisc002/bisc002_evoles5_pic007.jpg" style="width: 300px; height: 230px; margin: 10px;" title="Zebra Mussels"></span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Nonnative </strong>species can become introduced to an ecosystem and have wide ranging impacts of the species already present. One nearby ecosystem that has been invaded by non native species is the Great Lakes. While clearly a freshwater lake system, shipping traffic from the oceans has introduced roughly 90 nonindigenous water species over the last half century. One, the sea lamprey, has been found parasitizing lake trout species.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The zebra mussel is a species native to the Caspian Sea in Asia. In the late 1980's a ship took on ballast water in a European port and subsequently dumped that water in the port of Detroit. Since then zebra mussels have been found in all the great lakes. They have sharp shells that are ruining beaches and clog the water intake pipes of water companies and electrical power plants. They also attach themselves to other species and cause harm.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Overkilling</strong> is normally the result of commercial activities where certain species are targeted for their value as food. This is particularly true in the oceans of the world. Whale hunting has contributed to decimated populations of a variety of whale species around the world. Many species are now protected by international treaty in order to prevent their total extinction.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Some marine species are necessary to the existence of other species. Because of the value of some species to the local food chain, their extinction could lead to a chain of extinctions of other unrelated species. It's important for humans to monitor the impact of activities like commercial fishing so that harm is not caused to other species that humans rely on for food. However, these treaties are often ignored by ships from certain countries.</p></div></div>
