<p>A commonly misunderstood phrase is "Survival of the fittest". It really means that for a given situation, some individuals are more "fit" or able to survive and pass on these useful traits to offspring. This is a form of differential reproduction since only a few individuals will be able to have offspring. In the end the population will eventually contain a collection of individuals best suited to survive a specific, current environment.</p><p><img alt="" src="http://courses.ed.science.psu.edu/bisc002/sites/courses/ed/bisc002/files/bisc002/bisc002_evoless4_pic001.jpg" style="width: 429px; height: 343px;"></p><p>Traits will be preserved in offspring in proportion to their adaptive benefits. One common example is the use of camouflage which helps an animal escape a predator. For example, a snowshoe hare has white fur which provides it with good camouflage where there is lots of snow present (tundra/Arctic environments). However, in a wooded environment like here in Pennsylvania, a white rabbit would stand&nbsp;out in the brown or green forests and fields, and it LESS likely to survive long enough to pass on the white fur trait to offspring. We&nbsp;say that the environment puts a <strong>selective pressure </strong>on those individuals not well adapted to survive in that environment</p><p><script type="text/javascript" src="https://content.bitsontherun.com/players/OfdBtY5M-2pHRl6he.js"></script></p>
