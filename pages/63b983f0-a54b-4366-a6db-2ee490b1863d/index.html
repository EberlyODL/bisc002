<p>The creationist movement is mostly found here in the United States among fundamentalist Christians. The modern day creationist movement takes a literal interpretation of the bible as the only true interpretation. This view has not been the only view for Christians through history. In the early days of Christianity it was common practice to view the stories of the bible as metaphors used to teach or illustrate some point of morality. This was common practice for more than a thousand years of Christianity. Saint Augustine often took a metaphorical or allegorical approach to parts of the bible.</p>
<p>Things began to change at the time of the Protestant Reformation when Martin Luther held that people should focus on the scriptures alone and not the traditions of the church. At the time the Catholic Church was having problems and people like Martin Luther were attempting to reform what he saw as destructive practices. In the end he ended up creating a new church structure but was still hesitant to take a totally literalistic interpretation of the bible.</p>
<p>Later on, particularly in America and Britain another branch of Protestants, the Methodists took a more literal interpretation of the bible. Then the southern Baptists, in a sort of religious rebellion after the Civil War, took an extremely literalistic view of the Bible. At the time there was a change to industrialism that was seen as threatening to the agrarian south. Also the influence of "northerners" was being resisted on all fronts at a time when there was massive immigration from catholic Europe to the United States. The evangelical southerners were feeling threatened on several fronts all at once. They became very convinced that only through a literalistic view of the bible would their way of life be sustained.</p>
<p>All of these religious groups, as well as others, became politically and socially active and were involved in trying to influence the actions of society. Prohibition is one example of this activism. During this time everyone was also trying to reconcile the story of Genesis with the emerging scientific thought of the 1800&#39;s. Students were being increasingly exposed to the current scientific debate of the day with the emergence of Darwin&#39;s writings now being presented in schools. This brought on a creationist backlash partly fueled by some resentment of the Social Darwinism being discussed at the time. Social Darwinism or applying survival of the fittest thinking to humans was influential with political figures like Hitler during his rise to power. For these and many other reasons, some religious groups were extremely resistant to anything other than a literal interpretation of the bible. This influence is still strongly felt to this day.</p>
<p>More recently, when Ronald Reagan was elected president in 1980 the social conservatives gained more political influence. In a time after the sexual revolution of the 60&#39;s and 70&#39;s when AIDS was not understood and viewed as punishment for a promiscuous lifestyle, the so called Religious Right became active in many social areas. Among this activism was a push to return to a more wholesome way of life which included a closer look at education. It was during this general push that new attempts to bring discussions of religion back into the public schools took place. With this was a new interest in promoting the genesis story as a valid scientific explanation for the origin of life. Many court battles were fought during this time over the teaching of evolution and something called creation science. These court battles go on to this very day.</p>
