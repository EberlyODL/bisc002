<div class="art-postcontent"><div class="art-article"><p style="text-align: justify;">A recent fossil find in the arctic reaches of Canada gives another good example of a transition fossil. Approximately 385 million years ago a fish-like creature called Panderichthys evolved into a four limbed creature called a tetrapod. This process took roughly 20 million years and, until recently, there was no evidence of a transition&nbsp;fossil that&nbsp;showed how a fish became a four legged land creature.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span class="lightbox-processed"><img alt="" class="lightbox" src="http://courses.ed.science.psu.edu/bisc002/sites/courses/ed/bisc002/files/bisc002/bisc002_evoless3_weirdfishes.jpg" style="width: 442px; height: 586px;" title=""></span></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Scientists discovered a crocodile-like fossil they named Tiktaalik as the transition animal that breached the gap between fish and land animal. This newly discovered fossil shows an animal that has the ability to move freely on land something no other animal of this age could do. Tiktaalik has features that make it similar to fish, it has fins with webbing and scales on its back. However it also has features common to land animals like a reptile shaped head with eyes positioned on top. Fish have eyes on the sides of their head. Also, Tiktaalik has a structure in the front fins where a shoulder, elbow and early signs of wrist bones are present. These are all characteristics of an animal that walks on land.</p></div></div><p></p>
