<p>Meiosis is the process of forming haploid gamete cells, sperm or egg cells used in reproduction. A single diploid cell duplicates its DNA and produces four haploid cells. The process is similar to Mitosis in that the cell divides but in Meiosis, the&nbsp;cell then goes into a second round of division without replicating the chromosomes. Therefore the resultant cells have half the normal number of a diploid cell. They are haploid rather than diploid.</p><p></p><p>Watch the animation below for more details.</p><p><object classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0" height="450" width="600"><param name="quality" value="high"><param name="wmode" value="window"><param name="allowScriptAccess" value="samedomain"><param name="scale" value="exactfit"><param name="movie" value="/bisc002/sites/courses/ed/bisc002/files/bisc002/images/media/meiosis.swf"><embed allowscriptaccess="samedomain" height="450" pluginspage="http://www.macromedia.com/go/getflashplayer" quality="high" scale="exactfit" src="http://courses.ed.science.psu.edu/bisc002/sites/courses/ed/bisc002/files/bisc002/images/media/meiosis.swf" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="600" wmode="window"></object></p>
