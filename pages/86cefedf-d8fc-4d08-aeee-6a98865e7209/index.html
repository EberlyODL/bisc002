<p style="font-size: 16px;">The energy flow in an ecosystem shown by the trophic levels can be represented by a pyramid structure. Every time energy flows from one trophic level to the next, most of it is lost as work, heat, or metabolism. There is a rule about how much energy gets passed onto the next trophic feeding level called the Rule of 10's. It basically states that as energy passes through food chains, each successive level captures only about 10% of the energy from the previous level.</p><p align="center" style="font-size: 16px;">This pyramid shows that if plants capture 1000 energy units, an insect feeding on the plants will capture only 10% of the energy the plants captured from the sun.</p><p style="font-size: 16px;"><img alt="Energy Pyramid" src="http://courses.ed.science.psu.edu/bisc002/sites/courses/ed/bisc002/files/bisc002/energypyramid1.jpg" title="Energy Pyramid"></p><p style="font-size: 16px;">This means that insects will get only 100 energy units, since they had to find and process the plant material to energy they can use.</p><p style="font-size: 16px;">Now, a small bird may eat an insect, but it will also lose most of the energy and capture only 10% of the energy for a total of 10 energy units. This is why a bird has to eat many, many insects to stay alive.</p><p style="font-size: 16px;">Finally, a hawk&nbsp;may eat the small&nbsp;bird, but it will also capture only 10% of the energy available for a grand total of 1 energy unit. The hawk has to eat many small birds to stay alive.</p><p style="font-size: 16px;">Clearly, the farther along the food chain one goes, the less efficient the process becomes. The concept was described by an American chemist, G. Tyler Miller Jr., in 1971:</p><blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 700; line-height: inherit;">"Three hundred trout are needed to support one man for a year. The trout, in turn, must consume 90,000 frogs, that must consume 27 million grasshoppers that live off of 1,000 tons of grass."</span></p></blockquote><p></p>
