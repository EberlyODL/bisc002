<h2>Ecology is the study of interactions</h2>
<p>These interactions are classified on different levels. A <strong>population</strong> is a group of organisms that are living in a particular environment, and can interbreed. For example, we as humans form a population, as do the squirrels on Penn State campus. All of the populations in a given area, including different species, make up the <strong>community</strong>. For example, you could describe all of&nbsp;the critters, trees, flowers and&nbsp;grass on campus as being a community. <strong>Ecosystems</strong> are basically communities, plus the non-living environment that surrounds it, including air, water and minerals. We are living in an ecosystem here in State College, PA. The <strong>biosphere</strong> is one step even bigger than that - this term describes&nbsp;the parts of the planet and its atmosphere where life exists.</p>

<p>All&nbsp;life on planet Earth occupies&nbsp;discrete areas, known as <strong>habitats,</strong> that suit the needs&nbsp;of the individuals that live there. For example, camels are well-suited to their habitat in hot, dry&nbsp;deserts and in the same way, penguins are suited to life in the&nbsp;sub-zero temperatures of the southern hemisphere. As we know, there is a delicate balance of life and Earth can be a dangerous place! The population size of any organism is always subject to change.</p>
<p><strong>Births</strong> and&nbsp;<strong>deaths</strong> are key determinants of&nbsp;<strong>population number</strong>. Deaths in a population can occur for many reasons, such as disease, predation, accidents or competition for limited resources.&nbsp;If the birth rate exceeds the death rate, then the population will grow, however this trend cannot continue forever, because at some point at least one resource will become limited. Each habitat has whats known as a <strong>carrying capacity</strong>, which is basically&nbsp;the maximum number of individuals that it can support. <strong>Limiting factors</strong> can be anything from the amount of&nbsp;available space, to the availability of food. In addition, high populations numbers might attract more predators, or make it easier for diseases to spread quickly. And then theres the factors that can affect the population regardless of its density, such as fire, flood or some other type of disaster that will wipe out large numbers of organisms.</p>
<p>The human population has been growing exponentially for the last 2000 years, and continues to get bigger and bigger. Since the industrial revolution began in the late 1700's, progressive&nbsp;advances in technology and medicine mean that we have been able to "escape" many of the factors that would have otherwise reduced the population number. The environmental consequence&nbsp;of this is that we are putting a huge demand on our planet in terms of energy consumption which, in turn, results in pollution and ultimately climate change. More on this next week.</p>
