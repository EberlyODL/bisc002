<p style="text-align: justify;">There are two important things to remember when thinking about how Natural Selection works:</p>
<ol start="1"><li style="text-align: justify;">Natural Selection works on individuals</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Evolution works on the whole population</li></ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Evolution occurs within a species because natural selection leads to changes in the average genetic composition of a species. If a few individuals in a population have an advantageous <strong>phenotype</strong> it will take time before that <strong>gene allele </strong>becomes common in the population. Rarely is a new characteristic so useful that it enables the individual to avoid death before reproducing. Anything can happen; the animal can die of disease or fall off a cliff and thus remove the useful allele or phenotype from the population.&nbsp;Slowly over time, though, the more useful form will allow some individuals to evade predators more often than the other less useful form and will in the end come to predominate.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This frequently happens in response to changes in the environment. Sudden changes in climate can affect the food source of organisms and cause shifts in the usefulness of certain traits. Drought, loss of favored food sources and changes in migration patterns are examples of how climate changes can affect populations of organisms. Environmental pressures are a powerful engine that drives evolution.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">However it's critical to note that these environmental pressures do not create genetic variation. The environment merely selects from among the best of the available phenotypes in a population. Remember that genetic variation is the result of the mixing of chromosomes during <strong>meiosis</strong> as well as the possible random mutation to the genetic code of an organism. Given a variety of available phenotypes among organisms in a particular environment, some are well adapted to survival, others are not.</p>
