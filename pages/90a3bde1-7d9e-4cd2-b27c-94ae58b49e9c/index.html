<div class="art-postcontent"><div class="art-article"><p>Before discussing the process of Translation, there are a few more parts to the assembly process that need to be discussed. A ribosome is the assembly factory for proteins. Here the mRNA is translated and amino acids are physically connected to each other to form a protein.</p><p>A ribosome is like pair of shells that fit on top of each other . There is a top subunit and a bottom subunit that fit together onto an mRNA strand. In addition the ribosome has two holes drilled into the top if it. One is called the A site and the other is the P site. There are the locations where amino acids will be placed in order to hook them together into a chain.</p><p><span class="lightbox-processed"><img alt="Ribosomes" class="lightbox" height="365" src="http://courses.ed.science.psu.edu/bisc002/sites/courses/ed/bisc002/files/bisc002/images/Ribosome.jpg" style="margin: 10px;" title="Ribosomes" width="571"></span></p><p>Another important assembly component is the tRNA or transfer RNA. This is a single strand of RNA that forms a particular cloverleaf type shape. On one end is a set of 3 nucleotides called the Anticodon. This set of 3 will base pair to a specific codon on the mRNA. At the other end of the tRNA is attached a specific amino acid.</p><p><span class="lightbox-processed"><img alt="tRNA" class="lightbox" height="207" src="http://courses.ed.science.psu.edu/bisc002/sites/courses/ed/bisc002/files/bisc002/images/tRNA.jpg" style="margin: 10px;" title="tRNA" width="244"></span></p><p></p><p><object classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0" height="500" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="600"><param name="quality" value="high"><param name="movie" value="/bisc002/sites/courses/ed/bisc002/files/bisc002/images/proteinTranslation.swf"><embed height="500" hspace="10" pluginspage="http://www.macromedia.com/go/getflashplayer" quality="high" src="http://courses.ed.science.psu.edu/bisc002/sites/courses/ed/bisc002/files/bisc002/images/proteinTranslation.swf" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" vspace="10" width="600"></object></p></div></div><p></p>
