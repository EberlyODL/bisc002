<p class="art-postheader">Recall that in meiosis some gametes can be formed with the wrong number of chromosomes. That’s how someone could be born with Down’s syndrome; a gamete had an extra chromosome. The problem of non-disjunction can also affect the sex chromosomes. Normally a gamete would contain one such chromosome. If non-disjunction occurs then a gamete could contain two X chromosomes or even two Y chromosomes. It’s also possible for a gamete to contain NO sex chromosomes. Whether that allows for a live birth depends on the sex chromosome that’s affected.</p><p><span class="lightbox-processed"><img alt="" class="lightbox" src="http://courses.ed.science.psu.edu/bisc002/sites/courses/ed/bisc002/files/bisc002/lesson04_07_clip_image001.gif" style="width: 300px; height: 246px;" title=""></span></p><p>For example, this punnett square shows non-disjuction of an egg gamete. When the cell splits for the final time in meiosis it could contain two X chromosomes or perhaps no X chromosome at all. If one of these gametes were fertilized normally with a sperm cell, the resulting offspring possibilities are shown.</p><p>Note that any fertilized egg lacking at least one X chromosome would never develop. You can’t get by with just a Y chromosome. There are genes on the X chromosome that are necessary for life. However, there is one option shown where the offspring would only have one X chromosome. This is perfectly fine. After all, every male on the planet only has one X chromosome…. Another option would be a female offspring with 3 X chromosomes or a male with two X chromosomes (XYY). All of these offspring would develop to adulthood but there are certain differences from the normal male/female phenotype.</p><p><strong><span class="lightbox-processed"><img alt="maleDisjunction.jpg" class="lightbox" height="401" src="http://courses.ed.science.psu.edu/bisc002/sites/courses/ed/bisc002/files/bisc002/maledisorders.jpg" style="border-width: 0pt; border-style: solid; float: left;" title="maleDisjunction.jpg" width="464"></span></strong></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>An XXY male has <strong>Kleinfelter syndrome</strong>. This is characterized by reduced fertility due to underdeveloped testis. This affects about one out of very 1000 males. Another example is <strong>XYY syndrome</strong> which includes some learning problems but little other phenotypic change. Some behaviorists have in the past suggested that males with an extra Y chromosome are more aggressive than others. No study has ever shown an increase in aggression though this outdated concept still persists.</p><p><strong><span class="lightbox-processed"><img alt="femaleDisjunction.jpg" class="lightbox" height="478" src="http://courses.ed.science.psu.edu/bisc002/sites/courses/ed/bisc002/files/bisc002/femaledisorder.jpg" style="border-width: 0pt; border-style: solid;" title="femaleDisjunction.jpg" width="499"></span></strong></p><p>In the female side, it is possible for a girl baby to be born with just one X chromosome. This is <strong>Turner Syndrome</strong>, which exhibits certain physical traits including short stature, undeveloped secondary sex characteristics and often learning disabilities. Another possibility is Triple X syndrome. Other than being a bit taller than average there are no obvious physical or mental differences between these women and those with two X chromosomes.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>
