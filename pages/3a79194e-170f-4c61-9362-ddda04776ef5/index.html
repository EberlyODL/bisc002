<p style="text-align: justify;">When Darwin read Malthus's essay on the principle of populations he had the key to explaining all he had seen. What started out as some light reading for fun turned into the cornerstone of how evolution works. Malthus wrote that populations cannot expand indefinitely, that competition for resources inevitably led some individuals to survive while others did&nbsp;not.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">To Darwin this explained how populations of animals in the wild are able to remain stable. Since a significant percentage of individuals in a population are destroyed in the struggle for survival, and only a select few survive to reproduce, he wondered if those who reproduced (and thus passed on their traits) had advantageous traits that were useful to survival. In this way, over time, some traits would be preserved in a population and others would be slowly removed.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>As he later wrote in his autobiography:</strong></p>
<div><blockquote style="text-align: justify;"><em>In October 1838, that is, fifteen months after I had begun my systematic enquiry, I happened to read for amusement Malthus on Population, and being well prepared to appreciate the struggle for existence which everywhere goes on from long-continued observation of the habits of animals and plants, it at once struck me that under these circumstances favourable variations would tend to be preserved, and unfavourable ones to be destroyed. The result of this would be the formation of new species. Here, then, I had at last got a theory by which to work.</em></blockquote></div>
