When bacteria reproduce they divide to form two new cells identical to the original cell. They are technically referred to as clones of each other. It’s also possible to clone a fragment of DNA to make multiple copies of an original strand. Done correctly, the new strands of DNA will be identical in the letter sequence to the original strand. However, when most people hear the word cloning, they’re likely talking about copying an entire organism. If an unfertilized egg cell is taken from a donor and the nucleus of an adult animal is inserted, you’d have the first cell of a new organism that’s 100% identical to all the cells in the adult animal. That’s how cloning works.</p><p>Cloning a living organism has been the stuff of science fiction books and movies for decades. The process of creating a new organism using the DNA of an older already living organism has become a reality. This process has been used on a variety of animals to date. The image shows the fundamental process.</p><p>In the end, a baby animal is produced that is the exact combination of genetic material that the original adult animal has. The baby lamb is the genetic twin of the adult animal, it’s just younger.</p>
