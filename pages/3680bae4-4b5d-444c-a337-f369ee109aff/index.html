<div class="art-postcontent"><div class="art-article"><p>Sometimes multiple influences come to play in a single situation. It's possible to have both biotic and abiotic pressures driving the behavior of a species. An example of this is the timing of bird migration. Many bird species migrate south for the winter and then return north each spring. These are species that depend largely on insects for food, clearly a biotic pressure. They make the long journey north each year to take advantage of the abundant summer insects in northern forests.</p><p>The tricky part for the birds is figuring out when to leave the warm tropics to head north at the right time to find insects getting active in spring. How do they know when the time is right? To a significant extent, it is based on increasing hours of sunlight. This would be an abiotic pressure. The hours of light are monitored by the Pineal gland in the brain. When the hours of sunlight reach a certain minimum threshold, the instinctual urge to migrate is stimulated in the brain.</p><p><span class="lightbox-processed"><img alt="" class="lightbox" src="http://courses.ed.science.psu.edu/bisc002/sites/courses/ed/bisc002/files/bisc002/bisc002_evoless4_pic004.jpg" style="width: 442px; height: 402px;" title=""></span></p><p>The process of "counting" the hours of daylight in the brain depends on enzymes (i.e. proteins). These of course are "built" (i.e. protein synthesis on ribosomes) from instructions in genes, through the genetic code. Like any other genetic trait, eye color for example, there are variations in individual birds in the workings of their time-keeping mechanism in the brain. Thus, while most birds start their migration within a small window of dates, some leave earlier than average, others later than average.</p><p>Those that leave early face the risk of arriving in the north too soon in the spring season, while it is still cold and there are few insects yet available for food. These birds may starve. On the other hand, birds that leave late may fail to find a breeding territory or a mate because others have gotten there first. In either case, too early or too late, these birds often fail to breed. They seldom pass on their genes and so the alleles that caused leaving at the "wrong time" remain relatively rare in the population.</p><p>The majority of birds leave "on time", usually arriving north just as the weather is warming up, insect food is abundant, and there are still unclaimed territories and available mates. They are favored by natural selection because they are usually successful in breeding and passing on their particular alleles, including those that allow them to "correctly" interpret hours of daylight, which in turn dictate the critical timing of departure from the tropics and of their arrival in the north.</p><p>In recent years, observations from many places have indicated that, on average, some birds are migrating north earlier and are being successful. In other words, it seems that natural selection of migration dates may be changing in favor of those birds that leave a bit early. Why might this be occurring? What would the effects of Global warming be on the timing of migration in birds?</p></div></div><p></p>
