<p>Many bacteria are exhibiting an increase in resistance to a wide variety of anitbiotics. MRSA is an antibiotic resistant strain of a common skin organism, Staphylococcus aureus. This organism causes a variety of potentially serious skin infections. The MRSA strain is so resistant to antibiotics that patients are kept in a separate room so they cannot come into contact with others and spread the illness. Only a couple of antibiotics are known to work against this disease and if the organism becomes resistant to these antibiotics of last resort, we'll be completely unable to treat the illness in anyone.</p><p>The use of antibiotics against the bacterial world is a form of artificial selection that acts on a population of organisms such that only the most resistant will survive. In order for antibiotics to work properly, they must be taken for the full 10-14 days that a doctor directs. Unfortunately, over the years people have neglected to take their prescriptions as directed and they quit the medicine once they feel better. This leads to the deaths of the bacteria in that population that are most sensitive to the antibiotic. Those individual bacteria that have a genetic resistance to the antibiotic are left behind to proliferate once the drug is removed from the system. This regenerates a new population of slightly resistant bacteria.</p><p><img alt="Cartoon by Nick D Kim, nearingzero.net.

These days, even hand soap has antibacterial agents in it. There is some research to suggest that bacteria are now developing resistance to other common cleaning agents that people use to clean their house. As we wage chemical warfare on bacteria, they are growing stronger as they develop mechanisms that allow them to avoid destruction by our antibiotics. In a sense, we're actively encouraging the growth of "super" bacteria that could easily one day be immune to any of our drugs. This is an example of evolution in action that we can see going on today over a few decades worth of time.</p>
