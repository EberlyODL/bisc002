Autotrophs collect energy into the system. These are the producers of organic energy compounds and include plants or phytoplankton. Heterotrophs then consume this stored energy for their use. In addition to the flow of energy, various materials are cycled through the ecosystem. These materials include carbon and nitrogen necessary to living organisms.</p>
