<div class="art-postcontent"><div class="art-article"><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Divergent evolution</strong> describes how a common form can become slightly modified over time into several new forms. For example the forelimb of many vertebrates has the same general set of bones in it, yet the bones themselves have changed shape over time to allow very different uses of the forelimb. The same bones are present in humans or four legged creatures as well as in a whale or bird and bats wing. The bones though are in very different shapes to support the structure of an arm, leg or wing. This evidence suggests that a common ancestor had developed a limb structure that has been used by descendants for very different functions.</p></div></div><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span class="lightbox-processed"><img alt="" class="lightbox" src="http://courses.ed.science.psu.edu/bisc002/sites/courses/ed/bisc002/files/bisc002/divergentevolution.png" style="width: 550px; height: 400px;" title=""></span></strong></p>
