<p>This is a fatal genetic disease where there is too little of a specific enzyme produced to remove a buildup of excess lipids in brain tissue. Tay-Sachs disease causes severe brain damage, enlargement of the head, convulsions, blindness, deafness, lack of energy and, eventually, death. Children appear normal at birth but symptoms appear around 6 months. Most do not live beyond 5 years old.</p><p>Homozygous recessives do not have enough lipid degrading enzyme. Thus lipids accumulate and affect brain cells. Heterozygous individuals produce enough enzyme and are not affected.</p><p>Tay-Sachs carriers are found most frequently among families of eastern European Jewish descent (Ashkenazi Jews). In the United States today, approximately one in every 27 (4%) Jews is a Tay-Sachs carrier. Among Jews of Sephardic origin and in the general, non-Jewish population, the carrier rate is about one in 250.</p>
