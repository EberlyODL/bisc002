<div class="art-postcontent"><div class="art-article"><p>A smaller but interesting extinction occurred during the Pleistocene when many of the large fur covered animals that lived during the great ice ages became extinct. These "woolies" like the wooly mammoth (as well as sabre-tooth tiger, camels, giant bears, and giant wolf species) disappeared fairly recently, roughly 10.000 years or so ago.</p>

<p>Scientists believe this extinction may have been caused by overhunting by humans moving into the Americas from Asia. The woolies and others had evolved in absence of humans (unlike large animals in Africa) and thus had not developed natural instincts to allow them to survive the technology (i.e. weapons, primitive as they may have been) of the newly arrived humans; a good example of a new environmental factor to which those animals did not adapt.</p></div></div>
