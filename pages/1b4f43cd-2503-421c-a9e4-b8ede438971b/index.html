This animal has characteristics of both reptile and bird. It evolved from a series of ancestral forms to provide the link between dinosaurs and birds. Current evidence suggests that birds evolved from the dinosaurs. There were, after all, flying dinosaurs, and we have fossils that show what these looked like. Pictured&nbsp; to the right and left here is a <strong>pteranodon</strong>. While capable of flight, it is not the ancestor of modern birds, it is pure dinosaur.</p><p><span class="lightbox-processed"><img alt="Photo by Laurie Minor- Penland: Smithsonian Institution" class="lightbox" src="http://courses.ed.science.psu.edu/bisc002/sites/courses/ed/bisc002/files/bisc002/bisc002_evoless3_pic004.jpg" style="width: 302px; height: 153px;" title="Photo by Laurie Minor- Penland: Smithsonian Institution"></span></p><p style="text-align: left; ">We know from the fossil record that some dinosaurs did in fact have feathers.</p><p style="text-align: left; "><strong><span class="lightbox-processed"><img alt="mage source Dinosaur-World.com copyright 2004-2007 Feenixx Publishing, Inc." class="lightbox" src="http://courses.ed.science.psu.edu/bisc002/sites/courses/ed/bisc002/files/bisc002/bisc002_evoless3_pic005.gif" style="width: 417px; height: 255px;" title="mage source Dinosaur-World.com copyright 2004-2007 Feenixx Publishing, Inc."></span></strong></p><p style="text-align: left; "><strong>Sinosauropteryx</strong> is an example.

Both of these dinosaurs had more developed feathers for insulation although the body structure was not suitable for actual flight. Here is an image of Caudipteryx.</p><p style="text-align: left; "><span class="lightbox-processed"><img alt="Image source Dinosaur-World.com copyright 2004-2007 Feenixx Publishing, Inc." class="lightbox" src="http://courses.ed.science.psu.edu/bisc002/sites/courses/ed/bisc002/files/bisc002/bisc002_evoless3_pic008.gif" style="float: left; width: 325px; height: 299px; " title="Image source Dinosaur-World.com copyright 2004-2007 Feenixx Publishing, Inc."></span></p><p style="text-align: left; "></p><p style="text-align: left; "></p><p style="text-align: left; "></p><p style="text-align: left; "></p><p style="text-align: left; "></p><p style="text-align: left; "></p><p style="text-align: left; "></p><p style="text-align: left; "></p><p style="text-align: left; ">Finally <strong>Archaeopteryx</strong>, is found in the fossil record next and it was the first feathered reptile capable of actual flight. The feathers are fully developed for flight, not just for insulation and the bone structure is very reminiscent of modern day birds. However, this animal still retains some reptilian features like tiny teeth and a long bony tail. While probably not a very good flier over time natural selection would work to create descendants capable of long flights.</p><p style="text-align: left; "><span class="lightbox-processed"><img alt="Photo courtesy of the Royal Tyrrell Museum, Drumheller, Alberta" class="lightbox" src="http://courses.ed.science.psu.edu/bisc002/sites/courses/ed/bisc002/files/bisc002/bisc002_evoless3_pic009.gif" style="width: 263px; height: 332px;" title="Photo courtesy of the Royal Tyrrell Museum, Drumheller, Alberta"></span></p><p style="text-align: left; ">One of only a few fossil specimens is shown below. Note the feathers that were preserved. Comparative anatomy studies show that this species has some characteristics found only in birds and other characteristics found in reptiles. Thus we have one good example of a classical transition fossil.</p>
