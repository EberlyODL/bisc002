<p><strong>Is the manipulation of genes in living organisms new?</strong>&nbsp; <strong>NO!</strong></p>
<ul><li>selective breeding programs have existed since before the age of recorded history</li><li>breeds of dogs, cats and farm animals have been "created" by people</li><li>simply have animals with desirable traits have offspring</li><li>can do the exact same thing with plants</li></ul>
<p><strong>Public concern and GMO's</strong></p>
<ul><li>There is an increased sensitivity about the safety of these plants</li><li>Plants have been genetically modified, are they harmful now?<ul><li>No.&nbsp; Tremendous research is involved to ensure safety.</li></ul></li></ul>
<ul><li>Common worries<ul><li>Toxic foods (allergies)</li><li>Gene transfer from one plant to another</li><li>Loss of biodiversity (ecological devastation)</li></ul></li></ul>
<ul><li>This concern is especially relevant in Europe</li><li>Sensitive about food safety issues due to Mad Cow Disease</li></ul>
<p><strong>GMO vs. "Natural" breeding</strong></p>
<ul><li>selectively breeding 2 organisms <strong>may</strong> result in new phenotype</li><li><strong>will</strong> result in thousands of genotypic changes</li></ul>
<ul><li>genetic engineering results in change of a single genotype (insert a gene)</li><li>will give the desired phenotype</li><li>genes are well characterized and function is well known</li></ul>
<p><strong>Overall, genetic engineering is LESS likely to lead to unknown gene effects</strong></p>
