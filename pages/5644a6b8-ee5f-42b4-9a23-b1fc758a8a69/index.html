<p class="art-postheader">This lesson focuses on using the tools of biotechnology to manipulate the genes of living organisms. Using recombinant DNA technology it is possible to create transgenic organisms and treat genetic diseases in humans. There are three basic areas of genetic manipulation of living organisms, bacteria, plants and animals, including humans.</p><p><span class="lightbox-processed"><img alt="Glo Fish" class="lightbox" src="http://courses.ed.science.psu.edu/bisc002/sites/courses/ed/bisc002/files/bisc002/bisc002_genless8_glofish_005.jpg" style="width: 200px; height: 133px; margin: 10px;" title="Glo Fish"></span></p><h3><strong>Learning Objectives</strong></h3><p>Upon completion of this lesson students will be able to:</p><ul type="disc"><li>Describe how genes are transferred into bacteria</li><li>Define Vector</li><li>Describe how vectors are created</li><li>Describe how genes are transferred into plants</li><li>Describe how gene therapy works</li></ul>
