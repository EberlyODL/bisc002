<p>Creationism encompasses the belief that all of nature came into being at the hands of an all powerful force or creator. Different religions believe in different gods but the common thread is that some being or beings caused the entire natural world to come into existence. In this sense, Christians, Muslims and Jews are all creationists. They all believe that God created the heavens and the earth and continues to be involved in the creation to this day.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, creationists believe in the biblical description of the origins of the earth as literal fact. They do not view the bible as a book of morality along but also as a history and science text where the stories listed there actually happened as a matter of historical fact.</p>
<p>From there creationists break up into many different groups with slightly different takes on this basic premise.</p>
