<p style="text-align: justify;">Since the discovery of antibiotics in the last century, humans have been waging chemical warfare against bacteria in an effort to prevent deaths due to infection. Ironically, antibiotics are a class of chemicals derived from bacteria and other microorganisms. Some microorganisms like soil dwelling bacteria and various molds, naturally secrete chemicals that are deadly to other microorganisms as part of the struggle for resources in their surroundings.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span class="lightbox-processed"><img alt="http://www.rostra.dk/louis/andreart/Alexander_Fleming.html" class="lightbox" src="http://courses.ed.science.psu.edu/bisc002/sites/courses/ed/bisc002/files/bisc002/bisc002_evoless3_pic014.gif" style="width: 385px; height: 307px;" title="http://www.rostra.dk/louis/andreart/Alexander_Fleming.html"></span></p><p style="text-align: justify;">It was Sir Alexander Fleming in the late 1800's who first noticed that one microorganism was capable of killing another. His discovery of penicillin ushered in a new age of medical treatment of otherwise deadly diseases. However, he only took advantage of what nature already provided. Apparently microorganisms have been at war with each other for some years.</p><p><img alt="Image from the U.S. National Library of Medicine" class="lightbox" src="http://courses.ed.science.psu.edu/bisc002/sites/courses/ed/bisc002/files/bisc002/bisc002_evoless3_pic019.gif" style="width: 495px; height: 351px;"></p><p style="text-align: justify;">During World War II, antibiotics were mass produced like never before and were subsequently widely used in the treatment of infections.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">In the years since then, microbes have developed a substantial resistance to a variety of common antibiotics. In the 1940's a soldier returning from war would be treated for a case of Gonorrhea with 200,000 units of penicillin. Today the minimum dosage would be 4,800,000 units of penicillin. That represents a 24 fold increase over several decades. Clearly something is going on in bacterial populations that are making them different from those in the recent past.</p>
