<div class="art-postcontent"><div class="art-article"><p><strong>Producers</strong> tend to be autotrophic, which means they capture energy and create carbon compounds from inorganic sources. For example, plants are photoautotrophs, which means they get energy from the sun and take CO2 out of the air to use the carbon to form sugars and other organic compounds. In the process they release the O2 into the atmosphere.</p><p><strong><span class="lightbox-processed"><img alt="Autotrophs/Heterotrophs" class="lightbox" src="http://courses.ed.science.psu.edu/bisc002/sites/courses/ed/bisc002/files/bisc002/autotrophs.jpg" style="width: 403px; height: 382px;" title="Autotrophs/Heterotrophs"></span></strong></p><p><strong>Consumers </strong>are heterotrophic organisms in that they obtain both energy and carbon by consuming other organic materials and living organisms. Examples of these include Herbivores, Carnivores, and Parasites. The <strong>Decomposers</strong> also belong to this group.</p><ul><li><strong>Herbivores</strong> are animals that eat plants. Cows eat plants for energy and to absorb the organic nutrients needed to sustain life.</li><li><strong>Carnivores</strong> eat other animals for food. Lions and Tigers and Bears, oh my!&nbsp; Animal tissues are a rich source of all necessary organic materials needed for life.</li><li><strong>Omnivores</strong> eat both animals and plants. Humans are a good example of an omnivore species.</li><li><strong>Parasites</strong> take nourishment from a living host to sustain themselves. Viruses cannot even reproduce themselves unless they infect a host cell.</li><li><strong>Decomposers</strong> are heterotrophs that get energy and carbon from dead or decomposing organic matter. They also help cycle nutrients back into the ecosystem. Fungi, bacteria, and even earthworms are examples of decomposers.</li></ul><h3>Trophic or Feeding levels</h3><p style="font-size: 16px;">Nutrients are necessary to sustain life. Chemical energy is stored in the chemical bonds of food molecules. Since plants are the base of all energy systems, all energy ultimately comes from the sun. Without the chemical process of photosynthesis, organic matter could not be continuously created to be used as food by all other species of consumers. While chemical compounds may be recycled, energy is not. Once used it is lost from the system, usually in the form of waste heat production.</p><p style="font-size: 16px;"><span style="line-height: 23.2727px;"><img src="assets/foodwebb.jpg" width="676" height="600" alt=""></div></div></div></div><p></p>
