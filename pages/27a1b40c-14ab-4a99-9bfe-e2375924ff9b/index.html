<p>Some scientists argue that we are on the verge of another mass extinction; the 6th great extinction. It's been estimated by some that somewhere between 30 and 70% of all living species may become extinct in the next half century. This claim is based on some evidence and some guesswork so the authenticity of this claim is in doubt. However, we are witnessing large changes in ecosystems mostly due to the activity of humans. As we make changes to the habitat around us by building houses, roads and shopping malls, we impact other species. Breaking up habitat by construction and urban sprawl can add pressures which cause a species that's otherwise just getting by to begin a decline towards extinction.</p><p>For example, a single bird species goes extinct roughly every 100 years. This is based on historical and fossil evidence. In the last two hundred years more than 100 bird species have become extinct and many more are currently on the endangered species list. Considering that over this amount of time we should have lost about 2 species, we're then losing 50x more bird species that we should be. Clearly human activity has made an impact on other species on the planet.</p>
