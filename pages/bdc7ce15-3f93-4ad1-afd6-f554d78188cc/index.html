<p>Scientists operate using a series of core ideas that directs the way they approach explanations of the world around us all. Everything in the realm of science proceeds from the belief that the world itself is, ultimately, able to be understood. It's possible to figure out how things work if we're clever enough and work hard enough to make sense of an issue. Beginning with a simple question, like "how do birds fly?" has led us to understand the principle of flight well enough to be able to shuttle several hundred humans from one continent to another on airplanes, and even&nbsp;to send a smaller number of humans to the moon.</p>
<p>Other key ideas deal with the understanding that ideas in science are subject to change. The view people have of something today may change tomorrow, if we find new observations that influence the way we think. Someone once asked "why does the sun come up in the east and set in the west every single day?". A common explanation for hundreds of years was that the sun circles the Earth, and so the Earth must then be the center of the universe. Because of Copernicus we now know that the Earth itself rotates and this causes the sun to appear to move in the sky. The sun in fact stays in one spot, but the Earth moves around it and spins on its own axis&nbsp;at the same time.</p>
<p>Finally, scientists know that well developed scientific knowledge tends not to change much over time. Once enough observations are made and theories are tested over and over, even though adjustments are made now and again, big ideas in science rarely change in significant ways. New ideas in science are often just new applications of known ideas. Big shifts in thinking just don't happen very often; it's rare to scrap all previous ideas to substitute a new one.</p>
<p>Even so, scientists know very well that not all matters can be given a specific scientific explanation. Science is very careful not to attempt to prove or disprove say the existence of supernatural beings or supernatural powers. Science simply does not have the tools necessary to prove or disprove the existence of some events. Science is an explanation of an event, not a quest for ultimate truth in all things.</p>
