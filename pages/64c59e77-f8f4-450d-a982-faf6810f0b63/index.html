<p>Often referred to as IDC, this somewhat new version of creationism maintains that God&#39;s handiwork can be seen in all of creation if one knows where to look. This form uses science when it can get away with it, to create the impression of equal stature with mainstream scientific thought. They offer sophisticated arguments grounded in cell biology and mathematics to give the impression of complex scientific arguments.</p>
<p>Mostly, these arguments are all centered on attacking different parts of evolutionary theory, the idea being that if one part of evolutionary theory can be found to be incorrect then it follows that all of evolution much be incorrect. The term Intelligent Design is used to mask the fact that it&#39;s a form of creationism cloaked in scientific sounding ideas.</p>
<p>Other creationism forms: other religions Just about every ethnic people have an explanation for how the world began which are not based on the Jewish/Christian bible. There are probably thousands of these. Some are similar to those discussed, others are quite different. Islam, which also has different groups of people with somewhat different views on the subject basically follows the view of Theistic evolution. God created humans but may have taken a long time to do so.</p>
<p>Other peoples have more fantastic explanations about creation. The Finns have a story about a cosmic egg. The Chinese also refer to eggs. The norse speak of humans falling from the armpits of giants. Some believe that primitive forms of life like bacteria arrived here buried in asteroids that have impacted the planet in the distant past. Finally some groups like the Raelians believe that life was planted here by scientists from another planet. Since these extraterrestrial scientists have since visited the earth they&#39;ve been mistaken in the past as gods. (This is the same group who a few years ago claimed to have cloned the first human being. Failure to produce an actual person led to the claim being discredited, something about the mother being too shy for cameras). Still it is relevant to note that there are many beliefs about the origins of life other than the Christian viewpoint that is so often discussed in the news.</p>
