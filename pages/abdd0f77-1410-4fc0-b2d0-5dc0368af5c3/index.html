<p style="text-align: justify;">Darwin had now made a number of observations about the natural world:</p>
<ol start="1"><li style="text-align: justify;">Life exists in great abundance; there are thousands of unique species.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Genetic traits are passed from one organism to the next generation.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Some individuals in a population survive to reproduce, many do not.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">A slow and subtle change in organisms takes place over many generations.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">The Earth is much older than everyone thinks, so there's enough time for slow changes to make new species.</li></ol>

<p style="text-align: justify;">With this information in hand, Darwin was able to propose an actual mechanism through which evolution could work, and&nbsp;would lead to the formation of new species over time. Others had come up with proposals along these lines before. Lamarck for example believed that if an animal used a trait (like a long neck) and developed it (by stretching it to become even longer), that the altered&nbsp;trait could be passed on to the next generation. This is called the concept of inheritance of acquired characteristics. The behavior of an animal will allow it to acquire some characteristic (running fast for example) and this more developed characteristic will be passed on.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Darwin's idea was a little different. He proposed that animals are born with differences in ability or characteristics. From breeders he knew that not all animals born to the same&nbsp;mother were identical, there were subtle or even dramatic differences between offspring. Through the&nbsp;process of natural selection, these characteristics were either more useful or not to the survival of that individual. If a genetic variation made it more likely for an individual to survive to an age where they can reproduce,&nbsp;then that genetic characteristic would be passed onto the next generation.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For example, in a population of birds, one bird is born with a longer and sharper beak than its sibling. This bird then will be more efficient at digging insects out of the bark of trees than the others with shorter beaks. Thus nature selects this beak type as being more advantageous and this bird will be less likely to starve than the rest. Of course natural selection can work the other way as well. If a bird is born with a shorter and duller beak than its siblings then such a bird will have a harder time finding food. This bird will be less likely to survive and reproduce to pass on the short beak trait. Over time this population of birds would develop longer and sharper beaks.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">One key thing to note however when discussing how natural selection works is that&nbsp;selection refers to an individual, but the changes happen to a<strong>&nbsp;population</strong>. If a population of birds has beaks that are dull and short, regular, or long and sharp, natural selection will disfavor those with dull, short beaks. Those individual birds will die off. Over time they'll be less likely to survive and reproduce so the trait for short, dull beaks will be lost from the population. Even those birds with regular beaks, who will do just fine in a good year when there is plenty to eat will struggle to survive when food becomes scarce. In those years, the regular beaked birds will not reproduce as successfully as those birds with the long, sharp beaks. Natural selection through this competition (for food) will ultimately favor survival of&nbsp;the birds with&nbsp;the long, sharp beaks because they have this advantageous adaptation. If they survive to maturity, they will be able to&nbsp;&nbsp;reproduce. Thus over many generations, the population of birds will gradually shift towards a higher frequency of the&nbsp;long sharp beak trait.</p>
