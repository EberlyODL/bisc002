<p>In cases of Codominance there is no dominant and recessive pattern; things are more complicated than just two alleles. In codominance all alleles are expressed equally. A common example of this is the blood typing system. There are 4 blood types; A, B, AB and O. The blood type gene has more than just two alleles there are 3 alleles in this case and each one can be expressed on the red blood cells. However, a person can only have 2 of these 3 alleles, one coming from each parent.</p><p>A person can have an A allele, a B allele or an O allele. However, everyone has two of these alleles. So in the end, there are 6 different genotype possibilities:</p><p>1. AA<br>2. AB<br>3. AO<br>4. BB<br>5. BO<br>6. OO</p><p><img alt="" height="451" src="http://courses.ed.science.psu.edu/bisc002/sites/courses/ed/bisc002/files/bisc002/blood.jpg" width="282"></p><p>A person with the A allele will have a marker placed on all their red blood cells that identifies the cell as a type A cell. If the person has the B allele as the second allele they will then be blood type AB as <strong>both</strong> markers are placed on all the red blood cells. A person with two O alleles would be type O blood. While the A allele codes for an A marker and the B allele codes for a B marker the O allele does not code for an O marker. The O allele means that no markers are placed on the red blood cell. The O allele means zero markers are used.</p><p>Trying to figure out punnett squares in this case becomes a bit trickier than standard dominance patterns. Sometimes phenotype and genotype are the same but other times one canâ€™t tell the genotype based on the phenotype. A person with type A blood could have two A alleles. Or the person could have one A and one O allele. They would still have type A blood. The same is true of type B blood, a person could have two B alleles or one B and one O allele. When doing punnett squares one has to be aware of both possibilities.</p><p><object classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0" height="450" width="500"><param name="quality" value="high"><param name="movie" value="/bisc002/sites/courses/ed/bisc002/files/bisc002/images/punnett_tool.swf"><embed height="450" pluginspage="http://www.macromedia.com/go/getflashplayer" quality="high" src="http://courses.ed.science.psu.edu/bisc002/sites/courses/ed/bisc002/files/bisc002/images/punnett_tool.swf" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="500"></object></p>
