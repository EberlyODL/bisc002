<div class="art-postcontent"><div class="art-article"><p style="text-align: justify;">Translation is the most complex of the three processes performed by all living cells. A single stranded mRNA is now ready for decoding. The string of letters contained in a mRNA, the A’s, U’s, C’s and G’s now have to be translated into specific instructions for hooking together a specific series of amino acids into a chain to form a protein.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The letters of the mRNA are read in sets of 3. Each set of 3 letters forms a Codon or a code that represents a specific amino acid. Read the codons along a mRNA and one can see exactly which amino acids get placed into sequence.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span class="lightbox-processed"><img alt="Codon" class="lightbox" height="192" src="http://courses.ed.science.psu.edu/bisc002/sites/courses/ed/bisc002/files/bisc002/images/Codon.jpg" style="margin: 10px;" title="Codon" width="319"></span></p><p style="text-align: justify;">The genetic code then is made up of a series of 4 bases arranged into sets of 3 letters. That makes for 64 unique 3 letter combinations. However, there are only 20 commonly used amino acids used. There are then several codes that designate each amino acid. The following chart details all the codons and their corresponding amino acid.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span class="lightbox-processed"><img alt="Code of Life" class="lightbox" height="489" src="http://courses.ed.science.psu.edu/bisc002/sites/courses/ed/bisc002/files/bisc002/images/CodeofLife.jpg" style="margin: 10px;" title="Code of Life" width="474"></span></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Some of these codons are unique. The once in green is called the <strong>start codon</strong>: AUG. Three other codons, the ones in red are <strong>stop codons</strong> (UAA, UAG, UGA). By finding the start and stop codons it’s possible to find the exact sequence of amino acids used to construct a specific protein.</p></div></div><p></p>
