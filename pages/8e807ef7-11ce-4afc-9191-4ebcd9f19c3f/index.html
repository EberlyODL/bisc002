<div class="art-postcontent"><div class="art-article"><p style="text-align: justify;">Galileo Galilei is often referred to as the founder of modern experimental science for his work in astronomy and physics. His most famous contributions were in the field of astronomy. By this time, the first crude telescopes had already been developed, but Galileo went on to make improvements to make them more sophisticated.&nbsp;He then went on to use his new tool&nbsp;with great success. For example, he noted that the surface of the moon was not smooth and first described the rings of Saturn.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Telescopes were among the first tools that&nbsp;really excited everyone about studying the world, and what surrounds us. Humans had been fascinated with the stars and planets for millennia and they were used to predict planting seasons or religious holidays as well as for things like predicting the future. The new testament of the bible begins with a story about wise men following a star.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Galileo was convinced that based on his own observations, Copernicus was correct about his model of the universe where the sun was the center of the universe and not the Earth. Galileo decided to push this idea as the correct one even though it was still a very controversial idea at the time. The Earth-centric view was based on hundreds of years of belief with philosophical and religious implications tied in. To reject the Ptolemaic view of the universe also meant a possible rejection of many other areas of life, including many religious and political ones. The church rejected Galileo and Copernican astronomy as something being pushed by its nemesis at the time, the Protestants. They viewed this as an attempt to usurp church authority and they subsequently forbade Galileo from publishing his ideas.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Galileo did it anyways and his book became very popular. Of course he was then brought before the inquisition and placed under house arrest for the rest of his life. Since then, the Copernican view of the universe has of course proven to be accurate, and in the 1970's Pope John Paul II admitted the mistake of condemning Galileo's ideas.</p></div></div>
