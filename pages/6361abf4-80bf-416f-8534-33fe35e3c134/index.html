<p>One of the most common forms of creationism today deals with the earth as only being a few thousand years old. Much of this is based on Bishop Ussher&#39;s calculation of the age of the earth based on the genealogy found in the Bible. They believe the earth was created in 6, 24-hour days. While they agree that the earth is round and moves around the sun, they interpret all geology in light of Noah&#39;s flood.</p>
<p>An interesting offshoot of young earth creationism attempts to reconcile the belief in an earth not more than a few thousand years old with those who believe in a much older earth by using a creative twist to the story. The Omphalos argument states that the earth is very young but was created to give the impression that it&#39;s much older. This gets around the arguments of old earth creationists while maintaining a belief that the earth is only a few thousand years old.</p>
