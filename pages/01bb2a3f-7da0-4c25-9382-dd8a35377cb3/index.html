Gap creation discusses a large gap between the formation of the earth and the creation of all the animals and humans. The gap could be millions or billions of years old. This gets around the scientific evidence that the earth is several billion years old without having to believe in the process of evolution itself. Day age creationism is similar in the length of time but talks about each of the 6 days as really meaning a billion years or so of geologic time.</p>
