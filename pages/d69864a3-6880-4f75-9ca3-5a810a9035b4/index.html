<div class="art-postcontent"><div class="art-article"><p>By the early 1800's a new view of the Earth and all living organisms began to emerge, and this strongly&nbsp;suggested that things do change over time. Once the idea that organisms can change over time became more widely accepted, many started to wonder <em>exactly how</em> organisms can change.</p>
<p>Jean Baptiste&nbsp;Lamark was one of the first to suggest a method by which organisms could change over time. He argued that organisms do not change due to the environment they live in, but rather that altered behavior by an animal could change the function of an organ.</p>

<p>Lamarck suggested that, similar to the way in which a muscle that is exercised gets bigger, the way an animal uses an organ (or fails to use it) will change the structure of the organ itself. This is simplified into the concept of inheritance of acquired characteristics.</p>
<p>Others have explained this idea by using the example of the giraffe. How did the giraffe get its long neck? According to Lamarck's suggestion,&nbsp;originally there must have been a herd of short necked animals that fed on leaves from bushes and trees. Some of the animals would reach up to get leaves from higher trees and this would cause their necks to stretch. This stretched out neck would then be passed on to the next generation of offspring. Some of these slightly longer necked offspring would also then reach up to even higher trees for food and stretch their necks even further. Thus after many generations of this behavior, giraffes would all have long necks.</p>
<p>While Lamarck's ideas did not prove to be true, he does get credit for at least suggesting a possible mechanism for evolution. Not only did he acknowledge that organisms <em>do</em> change over time, but he came up with a possible explanation for the mechanism.</p></div></div>
