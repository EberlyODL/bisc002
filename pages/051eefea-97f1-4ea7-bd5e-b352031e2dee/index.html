<p>Genetic conditions and diseases linked to genes present on the X chromosome present a challenge when trying to follow inheritance patterns. Every person must have at least one X chromosome so any defects in a gene on this chromosome can affect the health of a person. The problem is, females have two copies of all the alleles but males only have one. Thus a female can have one functioning allele and one defective allele and still be normal. They would merely be a carrier for the trait. Males however, cannot be a carrier. They only have one copy of each gene and if it&rsquo;s a defective allele, the trait is expressed. There are no carriers, either the gene in question work, or it does not. There is no way to have a second allele to work in place of the defective one.</p>
<p>There are a host of examples of diseases that follow this form of inheritance. Some of the most well known examples include Hemophilia, Duchenne muscular dystrophy and Red-green colorblindness. Color blindness is a common and fairly innocuous condition affecting between 5 and 10% of males worldwide. This condition is passed down on the X chromosome inherited from the mother. Remember, a boy gets the Y chromosome from Dad so fathers cannot pass the trait on to sons. Fathers will however pass the trait to all daughters. The girls must get an X chromosome from Dad. He&rsquo;s only got that one to pass on. The only way for a daughter to have the condition would be if her father had it and her mother was a carrier and passed the defective gene on.</p>
<p>Hemophilia has been famously traced through the generations of royal families in Europe. Queen Victoria of England had many descendants, some of whom inherited hemophilia from her. This impacted the royal family in Russia, Spain and Prussia but is not present in the current royal family of Great Britain today.</p>
