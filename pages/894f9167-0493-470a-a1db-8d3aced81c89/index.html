<h2>Global climate change alters habitats</h2>
<p>In the past, scientists debated whether human activity could do something as drastic as alter the atmosphere of our planet. Now we are certain that this is true. Production of <strong>greenhouse gases</strong> are warming the Earth's surface. The greenhouse effect is being driven by an increase in the level of heat-trapping gases in the Earth's atmosphere, such as carbon dioxide (CO2). This build up prevents the heat from the sun escaping as it should, and the result is that the planet is warmed - similar to the way that glass traps heat inside a greenhouse.</p>

<p>CO2 and other greenhouse gases such as methane (CH4) water vapour (H2O), nitrous oxide (NO) and chlorofluorocarbons (CFC's) are increasing steadily in the&nbsp;atmosphere. Most of the CO2 in&nbsp;the past century&nbsp;has come from the burning of fossil fuels, such as coal, oil and gas. Furthermore, many of the major greenhouse gases can remain in the atmosphere for tens to hundreds of years after being released.&nbsp;If the current trend continues, we could see dire consequences, such as melting of&nbsp;the ice caps and an increase in sea levels of up to 24&nbsp;inches!! This will have utterly devastating effects on communities of animals that live in these polar regions, and world wide,&nbsp;as they lose the land and food&nbsp;they live on and are forced to change their lifestyle without having the time to adapt.</p>

<p>Climate change is already upon us - it's not just something we should be concerned about sometime in the future. The global temperature is rising, CO2 levels are rising and Arctic ice is decreasing at a rate of 13.4% per decade which is leading to increased sea levels. Life on Earth is already starting to suffer, and we can see this in the heart wrenching example of the polar bear. Polar bears do the vast majority of their&nbsp;hunting on the Arctic ice to feed themselves and their cubs. Decreasing levels and thickness of ice mean that their hunting season grows shorter and shorter with each passing year. A reduced ability to hunt means they cannot support themselves and the consequence is that&nbsp;they starve. Polar bear population numbers are already declining, and their future is in great jeopardy.</p>
<p>Climate change won't just affect wild animals, it will also directly affect us in terms of agriculture and public health. Changes in seasonal temperatures will mean that we can't grow crops in the same way.&nbsp;We may suffer from devastating droughts and see huge&nbsp;increases in disease incidence if, for example, tropical diseases such as malaria or dengue fever (transmitted by mosquitoes) are able to move into what were once temperate areas.</p>
<p>The good news is that we have at least&nbsp;realized our mistakes and are taking steps to prevent acceleration of climate change. Since the <strong>Environmental Protection Agency</strong> was created in 1970, several laws have been passed in an attempt to combat some of the worst environmental problems in the United States. Some examples include the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act and the Endangered Species Act.&nbsp;</p>
