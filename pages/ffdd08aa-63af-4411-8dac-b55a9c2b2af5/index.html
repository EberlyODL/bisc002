<p>As far back as we humans as a species can remember, we've been trying to make sense of the world around us. Early humans were very much focused on activities directly related to basic survival&nbsp;(how to obtain enough food, how to take shelter from the rain and the cold, how to make fire and tools, how to deal with the raw nature that surrounded early peoples consumed all the time available in the day). Stripped of all of our technology that makes us so comfortable today, early humans had much to fear when basic survival was the only focus in life.</p>
<p>Humans all around the world have created a wide variety of explanations for how the forces of nature work. Many of these explanations or stories were created at a time when people simply didn't know anything about how nature actually works. Many of these stories are recorded in histories of various peoples that have since become part of religious beliefs. One of the biggest questions we've pondered is: "Where does all of this stuff around us come from?". Creation stories are a part of many different cultures and many of these stories are a big part of religious tradition.</p>
<p>The topic of evolution elicits a negative reaction among some due to its attempt to explain the origins of living organisms, including humans, in terms that are based on observations of the natural world and not on those explanations offered that focus on the supernatural. Science does a pretty good job at giving explanations for the way the natural world works, particularly in physics and chemistry. The study of biology is more challenging because living organisms consist of very complex processes that can not be easily isolated and studied in a lab. It is also challenging because biology is full of exceptions to the rule. Still, it's worth exploring the way scientists talk about nature and how they give explanations about the working of the world around us</p>
