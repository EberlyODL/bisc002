<h2>Science vs Religion: Fact vs Faith</h2><div><div><p>A large part of the controversy surrounding the arguments over the validity of evolutionary theory in light of religious beliefs centers on the fundamental differences between science and religion. Science describes the natural world around us using a means of observation and empirical testing that can be seen, felt or measured by instruments. These observations then result in the development of scientific theories. These theories represent the best possible explanation of natural phenomena given the current set of data available. There is no attempt on the part of science to give opinions about the morality or purpose of the observed phenomena. It is what it is and science describes characteristics without passing judgment.</p><p>Religion mainly focuses on spiritual matters that by definition, cannot be seen, touched or measured effectively. Religion deals with philosophical matter pertaining to morality and concerns between humans and their god. It deals with matters that are not verifiable. That does not make religious issues irrelevant or unimportant; it merely is a completely different field of endeavor. Religion is less concerned with empirical observable facts but rather with faith, the belief in things that cannot be proven. Science rests on provable events; religion relies on believing in that which cannot be proven. The two views are very, very different from each other even though each is a valid worldview in its own context.</p><p>Problems arise when people of science or religion try to use their unique worldview to comment on the specialized areas of the other. Sometimes religion touches upon explanations of the natural world. These explanations are often based on information known centuries or millennia ago. These explanations are passed down over time and are not changed even in the face of sometimes overwhelming evidence to the contrary. It is when these archaic explanations are used side by side with current scientific knowledge that conflict arises. Each side puts for the notion that their explanation is correct. Scientists do not like to put observable and tested explanations up against ideas that were generated hundreds or thousands of years ago.</p><p>Those who from a religious perspective try to counter the ideas of evolutionary theory use biblical accounts of the creation and end up trying to support an idea that is not empirically provable. Scientists reply with calls to see the evidence which is not forthcoming because biblical accounts rely on faith that they are true. Thus the stage is set for controversy, each side maintaining that they alone hold the truth of the matter.</p></div></div><p></p>
