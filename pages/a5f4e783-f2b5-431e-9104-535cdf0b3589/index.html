<p>Most plants and animals have two sets of chromosomes found as homologous pairs. Such organisms are called <strong>Diploid</strong>. Typically these chromosomes are inherited from two parents. One complete set of chromosomes comes from each parent. In a human like you, half of your chromosomes come from mom&nbsp;and the other half from dad.

<p>Sometimes in humans we can find cells that do not contain two sets of chromosomes. Cells that only contain one complete set of chromosomes are called <strong>Haploid</strong>. These haploid cells are necessary when forming the gamete cells used for reproduction. Since a new offspring will need two complete sets of chromosomes, each parent can only contribute one half the total number needed.
</p>
<p>Thus, one set of chromosomes is found on the male sperm cell and another single set is found in the female egg. When brought together during fertilization, the resulting new cell will have two sets of chromosomes. It will be diploid.
</p>
<p>One complete set of chromosomes is often referred to as the N set of chromosomes. A haploid cell which only contains one set is called N. Diploid cells have two complete sets of chromosomes which is written as 2N.
