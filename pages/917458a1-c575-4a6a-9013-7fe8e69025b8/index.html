<p style="text-align: justify;">The <strong>5</strong><strong>th</strong><strong> great extinction</strong> happened at the end of the Jurassic and the beginning of the Cretaceous period also called the K-T boundary. This was the event that led to the extinction of the dinosaurs. The dinosaurs dominated the planet for 140,000,000 years. In comparison, humans have been around for a couple million years. Within a very short period of time, nearly all of the dinosaurs became extinct.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The cause for this is widely believed to be the result of an asteroid impact. There is a thin layer of a metallic iridium rock that dates back to this exact point in time. Iridum is not very common in the earth's crust but it is quite commonly found in meteorites. This iridium layer suggests that a large amount of the material was widely distributed across the entire planet at one time. Only a large asteroid impact accounts for this observation. A crater 6 miles deep and over 180 miles wide, roughly the size of Connecticut, has been identified near the Yucatan peninsula in Mexico.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">An asteroid would have had to be traveling at 100,000 miles an hour to make a crater of that size. Such an impact would have made a huge tsunami crushing anything living near a coastline. It has been suggested that such an impact would have sent tons of material up into the sky, effectively blocking out sunlight on a global scale. This would lead to the loss of much plant life upon which the dinosaurs relied. Without food, many would have become extinct.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Another more interesting theory is based on a recent asteroid impact on Jupiter. In that recent case it was noted that an area on Jupiter larger than the size of the earth became superheated when an asteroid impacted it. This has led some to think that the asteroid impact on earth that killed the dinosaurs may not have caused a cooling of the earth with a resulting loss of plant life. The global broiling hypothesis talks about a superheating of the earth's atmosphere and water from the ocean to a thousand degrees which would have literally cooked any plant or animal out in the open in a very short period of time.</p></div></div>
