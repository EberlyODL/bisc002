<p style="font-size: 16px;">The concept of an energy pyramid is of interest when we think about what humans eat. Being omnivores, we can eat either plants or animals. Most people eat both on a regular basis. However, consider the form of an energy pyramid when humans consume plants or animals.</p><p style="font-size: 16px;">This energy pyramid shows what happens when cows eat grass in the field and humans then have a nice juicy steak for dinner. It took 10 times more energy to produce the amount of calories captured in steak compared to the same amount of calories eaten from plants.</p><p style="font-size: 16px;">Consider the following energy pyramid.</p><p style="font-size: 16px;"><img alt="Energy Pyramid" src="http://courses.ed.science.psu.edu/bisc002/sites/courses/ed/bisc002/files/bisc002/energypyramid2.jpg" title="Energy Pyramid"></p><p style="font-size: 16px;">The energy pyramid below shows the energy transfer when humans eat the plants directly. In this case, we're second in the food chain, so we capture 10% of the energy imparted to the plants.</p><p style="font-size: 16px;"><img alt="Energy Pyramid" src="http://courses.ed.science.psu.edu/bisc002/sites/courses/ed/bisc002/files/bisc002/energypyramid3.jpg" title="Energy Pyramid"><br>From an energy transfer point of view, this is the more efficient use of energy in the system.</p><p style="font-size: 16px;">However, humans clearly show a preference for eating meat as well. Even though eating plants is 10x more efficient from an energy viewpoint, since the sun provides nearly limitless energy, the more wasteful practice of eating meat is negligible. There is more than enough sun energy being transferred to huge tracts of land where plants are growing, providing graze for animals.<br>There are other costs involved with raising animals to eat, though. The energy transfer issue may be insignificant, but there are a number of other issues that make eating meat an expensive environmental issue. Here are some facts about meat production in the US and the world:</p><ul style="font-family: 'Droid Serif', Georgia, serif; font-size: 16px;" type="disc"><li>65% of US water demand goes to taking care of livestock</li><li>375 gallons of water are used per pound of meat produced</li><li>50% of the world supply of grain and 33% of fish go to livestock for feed</li><li>roughly 5 pounds of grain produce 1 pound of meat (better than the rule of 10, actually)</li></ul><p style="font-size: 16px;">Here's another comparison between a meat-only diet and one consisting of vegetables, milk, and eggs</p><ul style="font-family: 'Droid Serif', Georgia, serif; font-size: 16px;" type="disc"><li>A chicken-based diet requires 8x more energy to produce (per calorie)</li><li>A beef-based diet requires 10x more energy to produce (per calorie)</li><li>A pork-based diet requires 15x more energy to produce (per calorie)</li></ul><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="0" width="90%"><tbody><tr><td><p align="center"><img alt="chickens" src="http://courses.ed.science.psu.edu/bisc002/sites/courses/ed/bisc002/files/bisc002/images/chickens.jpg" style="height: 188px; width: 250px;"></p></td><td><p align="center"><img alt="cow" src="http://courses.ed.science.psu.edu/bisc002/sites/courses/ed/bisc002/files/bisc002/cow.jpg" style="height: 375px; width: 250px;"></p></td><td><p align="center"><img alt="pigs" src="http://courses.ed.science.psu.edu/bisc002/sites/courses/ed/bisc002/files/bisc002/pigs.jpg" style="height: 155px; width: 250px;"></p></td></tr><tr><td><p align="center"><span style="font-weight: 700; line-height: inherit;">8X</span></p></td><td><p align="center"><span style="font-weight: 700; line-height: inherit;">10X</span></p></td><td><p align="center"><span style="font-weight: 700; line-height: inherit;">15X</span></p></td></tr></tbody></table><p style="font-size: 16px;">Consider the following: if the US demand for beef would decrease by just 10%, we could take 20 million acres of land out of agricultural use, OR, we could use that land to feed 60 million people.</p><p></p>
