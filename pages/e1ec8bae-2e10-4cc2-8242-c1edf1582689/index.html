<p>A big part of the answer lies in agriculture. The world population is steadily increasing and shows no signs of slowing down. With an additional 80 million people per year it's estimated that in several decades the world's population&nbsp;could double!&nbsp;The fastest growing regions on earth are also among the least able to provide food as it is. Over time the situation will only get worse.</p>
<p>On the other hand, world food production has been fairly stable over the last 30 years. The Green Revolution of the 1960's gave an increase in new seed varieties. The use of irrigation and chemical fertilizers allowed for an increase in production that was quite impressive. But the increases are slowing down....</p>
<p>This means that as population increases and food production stays flat, it will be harder and harder to feed the world's population without putting much more land into agricultural production. That's land that will also be needed for housing, transportation and other types of human development. Also some land is simply not useful for growing crops.</p>
<p>If we can't make more land or fewer people then increasing plant production is necessary.</p>
