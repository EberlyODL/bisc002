<p class="art-postheader">One of the earliest advocates of using the experimental method, Roger Bacon was a Franciscan friar who taught about Aristotle at Oxford College in England. He was very interested in the budding scientific disciplines of physics and alchemy. He wrote about optics and predicted the future development of telescopes, microscopes and spectacles.</p>
<p class="art-postheader">He's best known for advocating the study of science topics in colleges at a time when&nbsp;most of the curriculum was&nbsp;devoted to philosophy and theology. Because he was friends with the pope, his ideas were taken seriously (even though nothing much was done about it at the time).</p>
