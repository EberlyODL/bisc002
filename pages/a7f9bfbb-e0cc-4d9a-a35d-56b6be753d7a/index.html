<div class="art-postcontent"><div class="art-article"><p>Rene Descartes was a proponent of a philosophy called Rationalism. How do we know what exists, what is real? Descartes answered this by stating, "I think, therefore I am".</p>
<p>From this, he developed a system for gaining and testing knowledge which led to the formation of the modern scientific method. His philosophy encouraged others to question all previous knowledge until tested and confirmed. This led&nbsp;other scientists, for example, Sir Issac Newton down the path to his description of the law of gravity.</p>
<p>Descartes encouraged asking questions and then to make observations to answer the questions. Most importantly though, his philosophy encouraged others to question accepted knowledge of the times. In his day many accepted facts were not accurate. As an example, he was a supporter of Copernicus and his view on the workings of the universe.</p>
