<h2>Scopes Monkey Trial and Inherit the Wind</h2><p>One of the most famous court battles over the teaching of evolution in schools took place in the mid 1920's. At that time it was illegal in the state of Tennessee to teach evolution, not religion. The ongoing clash between fundamentalists and evolutionists reached a head when a young school teacher, John Thomas Scopes, chose to defy state law and had discussions with his students in class about the teachings of Darwin. Keep in mind that at the time Darwin's work was only a few decades old. The work was widely accepted by the scientific community but it was still somewhat new to the common folk, particularly those in the heavily fundamentalist South.</p><p>The so called "scopes monkey trial" pitted two very famous lawyers against each other. William Jennings Bryan was a well known presidential candidate who became the chief prosecutor. Known for powerful preaching at southern revivals he held folk hero status among those who believed in a literal interpretation of the bible. To defend Scopes was northern lawyer Clarence Darrow, another well know personality who also happened to be agnostic. The stage was set for a monumental battle between the forces of godliness against secular atheists. Poor Darwin was to be caught in the middle...</p><p>Please watch the movie "Inherit the Wind." You will find the link to view the movie in the Week 14 folder in ANGEL.</p><p>Propelled by forces of modern informational technology (it was one of the first trials ever broadcast live by radio) the case was followed by millions all over the world. Darrow was denied the ability to present any scientific evidence as to the validity of evolutionary theory. Having lost the ability to defend evolution he chose to put William Jennings Bryan himself on the stand. Having then proceeded to make a fool of Bryan, Darrow in the end lost the case and Scopes was found guilty of breaking the law. The fine was $100 which was overturned on appeal. The case was never pursued after that but the impacts of the trial eventually led to the repeal of laws banning the teaching of evolution. Today, the situation has completely reversed itself. Rather than being unable to teach evolution in school, it's now illegal to teach about religion in schools.</p>
