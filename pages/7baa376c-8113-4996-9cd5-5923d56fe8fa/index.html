<div class="art-postcontent"><div class="art-article"><p>James Ussher was a 17th centuty archbishop who used a literal translation of the bible to calculate when in time the creation story actually took place. By reading through the list of the prophets and other figures in the bible and calculating their ages he was able to state that the creation took place on Sunday October 23rd&nbsp;in 4004 BC. John Lightfoot, a contemporary of Ussher's put the creation at 9:00 AM on that date.</p>

<p>From that time on, the accepted view was that all living organisms were created at one time and that they have not changed since. Documentation of&nbsp;the enormous variety in wildlife&nbsp;at the time was a reflection of how the creator made unique creatures to perfectly fit into each unique environment.</p>
