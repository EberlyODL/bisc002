<div class="art-postcontent"><div class="art-article"><h2>Freshwater Biomes</h2><p>These&nbsp;include streams, rivers, lakes, ponds, and wetlands. Biomes that contain water derived from rain or snow are considered freshwater biomes. As water evaporates from the surface of the earth (or ocean), it is made up of pure water free of any contaminants. Water in clouds can pick up contaminants in the atmosphere, which are then brought back to the surface of the earth. This collects and pools on the earth's surface and runs into streams and rivers, even underground rivers that can be tapped when a well is drilled for a home.</p><p>This freshwater is found in a number of biomes that include ponds and lakes or rivers and streams. Freshwater only covers about 1% of the earth's surface, but contains almost half of all fish species. Freshwater biomes can be found in polar regions or tropical regions and every place in between. They can even be found inland on oceanic islands like Hawaii.</p><p><strong>Wetlands</strong> are important biomes because they act as natural filters. They include any area of land where the soil is saturated with water year round or at least during certain seasons. Unlike riparian buffers, which border streams and rivers, wetlands can also border lakes and ponds or form a contiguous area of swampy habitat. Marshes, swamps, and bogs are all examples of wetlands and may contain freshwater or saltwater. The Everglades are an example of a large wetland ecosystem that's important in Florida. Wetlands provide habitat for a wide variety of animals, and birds in particular thrive in such environments. While useful for filtering runoff contamination from water, they have been a target of draining and infilling for development purposes since they are not suitable for farming. It's estimated that half of the world's wetlands have already been turned over to development.</p><p>Freshwater fish are common inhabitants of these biomes, as are a wide variety of other plants and animals. Reptiles and amphibians are also common in freshwater biomes. Birds can be found feeding on these inhabitants. Many animals find food in freshwater biomes. Most of the world's human population lives near a water biome of some type.</p><p><img alt="" src="http://courses.ed.science.psu.edu/bisc002/sites/courses/ed/bisc002/files/bisc002/freshwater_pond.jpg" style="width: 500px; height: 375px;"></p><h2>Marine Biomes</h2><div class="art-postcontent"><div class="art-article"><p>Ocean water contains salt that has washed off the rocks on land over thousands of years. Ocean water is about 3.5% NaCl, and not all animals are adapted to living in such an environment. Saltwater fish and plants cannot easily live in freshwater, and freshwater fish and animals cannot survive in ocean water.</p><p>Marine biomes are easily the largest, covering nearly ¾ of the earth's surface and containing well over 90% of all the water on the planet. These vary widely, from polar regions to temperate continental shelf regions to tropical waters. One of the most biologically diverse marine biomes is the tropical coral reef.</p><p>Coral reefs are formed by living organisms secreting an exoskeleton of calcium, which forms a hard stony structure. One of the most famous is the Great Barrier Reef off Australia. The nutrient cycling that is typical of coral reefs allows for a tremendous amount of biodiversity even in waters that are otherwise nutrient poor. The organisms that make up a coral reef and the fish that swim in them are often extremely colorful. This type of ecosystem is sensitive to damage, and coral reefs around the world are in danger from pollution.</p></div></div><p style="font-size: 16px;"><img alt="" src="http://courses.ed.science.psu.edu/bisc002/sites/courses/ed/bisc002/files/bisc002/barrier_reef.jpg" style="height: 500px; width: 333px;"></p><h2>Terrestrial Biomes</h2><p style="font-size: 16px;">A wide variety of terrestrial or land biomes exist in the biosphere. Some of these are described below.</p><p style="font-size: 16px;">The&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: 700; line-height: inherit;">Tundra</span>&nbsp;biome is the coldest biome other than the permanent ice caps. Arctic tundra is found only in the most northern latitudes. Alpine tundra is found on high mountains, while Antarctic tundra is found near the South Pole. Tundra biomes have very little in the way of vegetation due to very short growing seasons and permanently frozen subsoils or permafrost. Biodiversity is low, although human encroachment is also low. In some locations, tundra regions are rich in natural resources like oil, so they are threatened to an extent. One major threat is the gradual warming of the earth. As temperatures increase, the permafrost can melt, changing the environment for the animal species that live there. Caribou, musk ox, and polar bears live in tundra regions. In the summer as the ice melts, large pools of water form, attracting many insects and bird species as well.</p><p style="font-size: 16px;"><img alt="Tundra" src="http://courses.ed.science.psu.edu/bisc002/sites/courses/ed/bisc002/files/bisc002/tundra.jpg" title="Tundra"></p><p style="font-size: 16px;"><span style="font-weight: 700; line-height: inherit;">Boreal Forests</span>&nbsp;are located along the northern latitudes below the tundra, but north of temperate forests. This is the largest land biome and covers most of Canada, northern Europe, and Siberia. Temperatures here fluctuate significantly from summer to winter. Conifers like pine, spruce, and fir are the predominant tree type, as they are better adapted to the cold winters. The ground is usually covered by moss or lichen, so the soils are usually poor. Animals common to the Canadian boreal forest include caribou, bear, and wolves. Smaller mammals include foxes, weasels, and lynx. Much of the boreal forest is suitable for logging operations, and most of the production in Canada is sent here to the United States.</p><p style="font-size: 16px;"><img alt="Boreal Forests" src="http://courses.ed.science.psu.edu/bisc002/sites/courses/ed/bisc002/files/bisc002/boreal_forest.jpg" style="height: 375px; width: 500px;" title="Boreal Forests"></p><p style="font-size: 16px;">A&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: 700; line-height: inherit;">Temperate</span><span style="font-weight: 700; line-height: inherit;">&nbsp;Forest</span>&nbsp;includes a wide variety of broadleaf and conifer trees. Broadleaf species such as oaks, maples, beeches, and birch trees can be found alongside conifers like pines, firs, and spruce trees. Such forests have a number of tall trees providing an overhead canopy, with smaller trees growing lower than the canopy. The lower level contains shrubs that provide cover for the animals that live there. Pennsylvania is covered in such a forest over much of the central portions and northern tier.</p><p style="font-size: 16px;"><img alt="Temperate Forest" src="http://courses.ed.science.psu.edu/bisc002/sites/courses/ed/bisc002/files/bisc002/temperature_forest.jpg" style="height: 375px; width: 500px;" title="Temperate Forest"></p><p style="font-size: 16px;"><span style="font-weight: 700; line-height: inherit;">Tropical rainforests</span>&nbsp;are found near the equator where the temperature remains high year round. It’s thought that 80% of the world’s biodiversity is found in tropical rainforests. More species exist here than in all other biomes combined. Even though much vegetation exists here, the soils are typically very poor as the high rainfall removes much of the soluble nutrients. Rainforests are targets of human development, particularly due to farming. Slash and burn methods convert huge swaths to farming, but the nutrients are quickly used up, leading to more deforestation. Many common foods originated in tropical rainforests, although many are grown in other locations today. Examples include sugarcane, bananas, coffee, and chocolate.</p><p style="font-size: 16px;"><span class="lightbox-processed"><img alt="Tropical Rain Forest" class="lightbox" src="http://courses.ed.science.psu.edu/bisc002/sites/courses/ed/bisc002/files/bisc002/tropical_rainforest.jpg" style="height: 375px; width: 500px;" title="Tropical Rain Forest"></span></p><p style="font-size: 16px;"><span style="font-weight: 700; line-height: inherit;">Grasslands</span>&nbsp;are areas dominated by grasses rather than trees, and are found on every continent (except Antarctica). About half of the continent of Africa and large areas of China are grassland, as is much of the middle portion of America. Here huge herds of bison once roamed the open prairie. The North American prairie is dominated by a variety of grasses much different than what is typically grown on suburban lawns. On the open prairie, the grasses grow 5 or 6 feet tall, sometimes reaching 9 feet tall! Today, much of the central part of the US is under cultivation. Much of the rest is currently used for grazing by ranchers for their animals. Sometimes trees can sporadically grow on grasslands, and when this occurs the area is referred to as a savannah. Much of the African grasslands are really savannah.</p><p style="font-size: 16px;"><img alt="Grasslands" src="http://courses.ed.science.psu.edu/bisc002/sites/courses/ed/bisc002/files/bisc002/grasslands.jpg" style="height: 375px; width: 500px;" title="Grasslands"></p><p style="font-size: 16px;"><span style="font-weight: 700; line-height: inherit;">Deserts</span>&nbsp;are defined as regions receiving less than 10 inches of rainfall a year. Without water to support significant vegetation, soils are thin or non-existent. Therefore, deserts tend to exhibit rocky or sandy soils. Plants well adapted to low water can thrive in the desert and reptiles, small mammals, and birds live in deserts. Surprisingly, deserts make up about one third of the landmass of earth. Deserts are not always hot, although that is the common perception. Polar deserts constitute a large part of the one third figure. Antarctica is essentially entirely polar desert. The Sahara is the largest hot desert in the world. The Atacama Desert in South America is so dry there is no real evidence of life there at all. NASA tested Mars landers there and was unable to detect any signs of life whatsoever. The tall mountains have no snow or glaciers on them. Some scientists estimate that the riverbeds in the Atacama have not seen running water in over 100,000 years!</p><p style="font-size: 16px;"><img alt="Deserts" src="http://courses.ed.science.psu.edu/bisc002/sites/courses/ed/bisc002/files/bisc002/desert.jpg" style="height: 375px; width: 500px;" title="Deserts"></p><p style="font-size: 16px;"></p></div></div><p></p>
