<h2 class="art-postheader">Dover Case and Kansas</h2>
<p>Modern approaches to creationism are designed to circumvent the legal precedent against teaching religion in the schools. Many religious people are ardent supporters of returning to a more faith based society and they clearly target youth as a means of inculcating a particular point of view. If young people can be reached before they develop their own views of the world then they will be more likely to have a religious perspective when they get older. Since evolution has been wrongly identified as an agent of the secular progressive society that they dislike many attempts are still made to discredit the tenets of this well accepted science.</p>
<p>The evolution (if you will) of the ID movement has focused on trying to beat scientists at their own game. Since the courts have disallowed an overt teaching of religion in the schools, Intelligent Design attempts to confuse those who don&#39;t fully understand science by camouflaging its creationist ideas as completely scientific ones. ID proponents use scientific terms and principles in a slightly misinterpreted way to reach completely opposite conclusions of those reached by evolutionary theory.</p>
<p>For example, they misuse the term theory to describe Intelligent Design. It&#39;s often purported to be a valid, if competing, theory as to the origin of life on earth. True it bases its explanation on the biblical account but then uses supposedly scientific facts to support the story of the biblical creation. After all they claim, it&#39;s just another theory. Who could be against talking about a legitimate scientific theory? Plus they throw in a bunch of claims that they&#39;re being persecuted by an atheistic media machine and elitist school board members.</p>
<p>The problem is that they way they use the word theory is not the way a scientist used theory. ID&#39;ers use the word theory in the common usage, just another possible explanation among a number of possible explanations each one as likely as the next. Scientists use the term theory as a well tested explanation of events that is alterable if new evidence is brought to light. (See the earlier lesson on the use of terms like hypothesis and theory) Those who espouse Intelligent Design could never think of a theory in those terms because to them the conclusion is NOT capable of being changed. The truth found in the genesis creation story is the only truth; it cannot be changed even in the face of new evidence. They are arguing from a totally different perspective but using, or misusing terminology used by scientists.</p>
<p>In the end all Intelligent Design proponents hope to do is confuse the generally scientifically illiterate public that the issue is open to debate. They hope to convince people that evolution is not really all that conclusive; it&#39;s just a guess, a guess that could easily be wrong. They won&#39;t explain that the theory of evolution is given the status of theory because it&#39;s so widely accepted and supported by data from very different fields of science. Calling something a theory really means that it&#39;s about as good as it gets in terms of good evidence. Only the concepts that science is very sure about get called a theory.</p>
<p>Another common error in logic comes from the very different perspectives involved in the member of opposite sides of the issue. Someone looking at the origins of creation from a religious perspective relies on the bible as evidence of what really happened. This is particularly important to someone taking a literal interpretation of the bible. Everything in that book must be true, if it is to be taken literally. Were any single story in the bible proven to be false, that would be a serious blow to a person&#39;s entire belief system. It is like a house of cards where the removal of any one would bring the whole thing crashing down. As a result any challenge to the preconceived notion is viewed as being very, very threatening. That&#39;s why it&#39;s such a touchy subject for so many. Heresy is not to be taken lightly and whole groups of people have been utterly destroyed in times past for daring to change the accepted beliefs of the time.</p>
<p>People with this view of religion would bring the house of cards thinking with them as they try to discredit evolution. To them, all they need to prove is one aspect of evolution false. Then the entire theory would have to be scrapped. The problem is that scientists don&#39;t take a literalistic view of their theories. In science a theory is meant to be altered in the face of new evidence. Hypotheses are altered all the time and no one is offended. Only when a hypothesis is tested over and over without modification does it become an accepted theory. Even then, all someone would have to do is show a fossil of a human riding a dinosaur and much of the theory of evolution would have to be altered. There are many ways to demonstrate that the current thinking about evolution is incorrect. It&#39;s just that every time someone makes a new discovery it reinforces the existing theory. If you think about it, anyone who could disprove evolution would be the most famous person in history since Darwin himself! Many have tried, but no one has offered anything resembling convincing evidence against evolution. The arguments against it are based in pseudoscience that does not stand up to review by other scientific experts.</p>
