<p class="art-postheader">&nbsp;Chromosomes are found in all living cells. They are often found as matched pairs containing the same set of genes even though the alleles on each may be slightly different. For example the gene for eye color is found on each of these <strong>Homologous</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Chromosomes</strong> even though one chromosome has an allele for blue eyes and the other chromosome has a gene for brown eyes. Therefore the Homologous pair of chromosomes are matching but not necessarily identical.</p>
