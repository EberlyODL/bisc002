<p>Species extinction is a natural part of the process of evolution. Some billions of individual species have become extinct over the course of earth history. The causes are many but they tend to come down to one common event: change in the local environment. Just because the environment changes for one of several reasons does not mean that species will become extinct. It very much depends on the ability of a species to adapt to those changes. Species who adapt to the changing conditions will survive; those that do not change will eventually become extinct.</p><h2>Learning Objectives</h2><p>Upon completion of this lesson you should be able to:</p><ol start="1"><li>Describe some of the major causes of extinction</li><li>Understand that there have been several great extinctions in Earth's history</li><li>Describe the impact that humans have had on the rate of extinction</li></ol>
