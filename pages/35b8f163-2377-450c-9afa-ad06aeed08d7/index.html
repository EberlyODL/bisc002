<p class="art-postheader">Charles Darwin was born into a wealthy family in England. His grandfather, Erasmus Darwin was a well known intellectual who had written about some ideas concerning evolution. Erasmus' grandson, Charles was destined to make one of the biggest impacts on science in all of history with his own ideas on this topic.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Charles Darwin grew up in a life of comfort living in the country. After boarding school he attended college to become a physician. He found that a career in medicine was not to his liking. It seems he didn't like the sight of blood or was just very bored with the study of medicine. He spent some time learning taxidermy and helped a friend stuff animals&nbsp;(not exactly a skill needed by a competent doctor!). However, from a young age&nbsp;had a&nbsp;passion for&nbsp;natural history and spent time collecting beetles. He changed majors with an eye to becoming a country parson, which would give him time to explore nature and add to his collections&nbsp;of bugs. While at school he developed relationships with a number of zoologists, botanists and even a geologist.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It was through these contacts that he was offered an opportunity to travel on the HMS Beagle to the South Pacific. Darwin's father originally objected to the voyage as not suitable to a theologian but through the intervention of an uncle, young Charles was permitted to go.</p>
