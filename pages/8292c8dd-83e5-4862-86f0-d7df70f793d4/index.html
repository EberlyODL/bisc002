<p>It wasn’t until a monk living in the Czech Republic named Gregor Mendel came along that people started to understand that inheritance followed certain predictable rules. He had trained in Vienna to become a science teacher so he had a strong interest in observing nature. Mendel didn’t know much about DNA or chromosomes but he was a keen gardener and observed how traits were passed through generations of pea plants.</p><p><img alt="Mendel's 7 Traits of Pea Plants" class="lightbox" height="444" src="http://courses.ed.science.psu.edu/bisc002/sites/courses/ed/bisc002/files/bisc002/peas.jpg" title="Mendel's 7 Traits of Pea Plants" width="499"></p><p>Mendel noticed that the plants had offspring with certain physical characteristics that looked very much like the parent plants. He wanted to explain how these characteristics are passed from one generation to the next in both plants and animals. He used pea plants because they exhibit certain phenotypic or observable traits that are easy to identify and cannot be confused. Mendel noted that for any observable trait there were two forms of that trait. The peas were either yellow or green, the peas were either smooth or wrinkled and the pods were either yellow or green. He noted that there were never any other options for each of the 7 traits he observed.</p><p>Mendel then conducted experiments where he self pollinated plants to observe a specific trait, for example seed color. Plants with yellow seeds that were self pollinated always produced seeds that grew into plants with yellow seeds. The same was true for plants with green seeds. After doing this for several generations he was always able to produce plants with the same characteristic. They were pure bred strains.</p><p>Then Mendel hit on another question that was to lead him to his greatest discovery. What if a plant that always bred true for green seeds was pollinated with plant that always produced yellow seeds? What would the offspring look like? It turned out that in such a case, the offspring would only produce yellow seeds, never a green one. What happened to the green trait? It seemed to disappear. No matter how many times he tried the experiment again, always yellow seeds, never a green one to be seen.</p><p>Mendel thought he would try one thing that may give different results. He decided to take two of these offspring plants that were only producing the yellow seeds and pollinate them with each other. When he did this a funny thing happened. About 75% of the plants would make yellow seeds just like they always did but a quarter of the plants would start making green seeds. The trait had reappeared!</p>
