<p>Bats are more closely related to whales than birds. This would not make sense unless the whale and bat have a more recent common ancestor than the bat and a bird. By studying the differences between species based on genetics we can tell how closely related two organisms are. The more differences we see, the less closely related they are.</p><p>This table shows the differences one sees if you look at the specific sequence of amino acids in the protein Hemoglobin, something commonly found in any organisms with a circulatory system.</p><p>Example: Hemogobin protein sequence (140 amino acids)</p><div><table dir="ltr" summary="" width="56%"><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="middle" width="60%"><u>Humans vs.</u></td><td align="left" valign="middle" width="40%"><u># different amino acids</u></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="middle" width="60%"></td><td align="center" valign="middle" width="40%"></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="middle" width="60%">Gorilla (ape)</td><td align="center" valign="middle" width="40%">1</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="middle" width="60%">Gibbon (ape)</td><td align="center" valign="middle" width="40%">2</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="middle" width="60%">Rhesus monkey (primate)</td><td align="center" valign="middle" width="40%">8</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="middle" width="60%">Dog (placental mammal)</td><td align="center" valign="middle" width="40%">15</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="middle" width="60%">Mouse (placental mammal)</td><td align="center" valign="middle" width="40%">27</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="middle" width="60%">Kangeroo (marsupial)</td><td align="center" valign="middle" width="40%">38</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="middle" width="60%">Chicken</td><td align="center" valign="middle" width="40%">45</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="middle" width="60%">Frog</td><td align="center" valign="middle" width="40%">67</td></tr></tbody></table></div><p></p><p></p><p>This chart shows that humans are distantly related to frogs but closely related to the ape family of primates.

The branch to the right shows fish evolution that culminates in sharks. Mammals took the left branch. However mammals then split into placental mammals and marsupials. The marsupial branch is shown here to cumulate in the marsupial wolf. The rest shows other branching leading to dogs, seals, cows and whales. Note whales are mammal and even though they look a bit like a shark and swim in the ocean they are only distantly related to sharks.</p>
