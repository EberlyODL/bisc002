<p>The beginning of a new life starts with the formation of gametes in meiosis. When a haploid sperm gamete meets a haploid egg gamete, there is a chance that both will merge to form a diploid cell. This new diploid cell or <strong>Zygote</strong> contains a mix of paternal and maternal chromosomes.</p><p><span class="lightbox-processed"><img alt="fertilization" class="lightbox" src="http://courses.ed.science.psu.edu/bisc002/sites/courses/ed/bisc002/files/bisc002/fertilization.jpg" style="width: 446px; height: 320px;" title="fertilization"></span></p><p>The first cell will then undergo mitosis and form a packet of cells. The cells at this stage are called <strong>Totipotent</strong> because they have unique properties. Each of these cells can become an entire organism by themselves if they were separated at this point. This is in fact how identical twins (or triplets) are formed. Beyond this stage the cells begin to specialize and they lose this unique ability. They begin to develop into the nerve and muscle tissue needed for the developing embryo.</p><p><span class="lightbox-processed"><img alt="twins" class="lightbox" src="http://courses.ed.science.psu.edu/bisc002/sites/courses/ed/bisc002/files/bisc002/twins.jpg" style="width: 418px; height: 314px;" title="twins"></span></p><p>Identical twins then arise when the early cell mass splits and each part implants itself into the lining of the uterus and eventually develop into not one, but two babies. Each baby has the same set of alleles since they are each descended from that one single fertilized cell.</p><p>Fraternal twins are different. They come about through the simultaneous fertilization of multiple eggs by different sperm. This is why itâ€™s possible to have twins where one is a boy and the other a girl. They come from two entirely separate fertilization events but both babies develop during pregnancy at the same time. Fraternal twins are no more alike in their allele combinations that you are with your brothers or sisters. Fraternal twins just share the same birthday.</p><p>Multiple births have become more common. It seems that stories of women having 5 or 6 or even 8 children are in the news on a monthly basis. While such events have always been possible they are far more common today due to the use of fertility drugs. When a couple has trouble conceiving the female is given drugs that induce the ovaries to release more than one egg per month in an attempt to increase the odds of fertilization. Thus it is possible for more than one (or two or three) eggs to become fertilized.</p><p>Others option include the fertilization of eggs outside of the body, a so called test tube baby. Multiple fertilized eggs are formed and then frozen for future use. Then physicians can insert a number of embryos into the mother. Extra embryos are used most times because some of them will not successfully develop during pregnancy. If 8 embryos are used maybe only one or two will be successful. Sometimes all 8 will develop and then octuplets are born and eventually appear on Oprah.</p><p><span class="lightbox-processed"><img alt="jon and kate" class="lightbox" src="http://courses.ed.science.psu.edu/bisc002/sites/courses/ed/bisc002/files/bisc002/jon%20and%20kate.jpg" style="float: left; width: 388px; height: 256px;" title="jon and kate"></span></p><p></p>
