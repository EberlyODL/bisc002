<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>One of the basic functions of living organisms is reproduction. For cells, that means making an identical copy of themselves. Cell division occurs millions of times every second in the human body to replace old or worn out cells with fresh ones. Itâ€™s also the process by which gamete cells, sperm and egg cells are formed.</p>
<p>The process of cell division is accomplished in one of two ways. <strong>Mitosis</strong> is the processes where an exact copy of the nucleus is produced followed by cell division. This produces two identical diploid cells with identical sets of chromosomes.</p>
<p><strong>Meiosis</strong> is the process used to produce haploid gamete cells. Since gamete cells, sperm and egg, are haploid rather than diploid a slightly different process is needed. Here a single cell makes a copy of all the chromosomes followed by cell division. Another round of division then immediately occurs to produce a total of 4 cells with <em>half</em> the normal number of chromosomes. Each of these 4 cells is of course haploid.</p>
