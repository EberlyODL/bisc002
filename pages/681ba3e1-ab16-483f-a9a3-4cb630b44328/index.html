<div class="art-postcontent"><div class="art-article"><p style="text-align: justify;">Biotic pressures are those where organisms interact with each other directly in the struggle for survival. One of the strongest selection pressures here is avoiding predators. Clearly if another organism eats you, it won't be possible to reproduce. Below are some examples of biotic pressures.</p><h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span class="lightbox-processed"><img alt="Images from NYPL Digital Gallery, Digital ID 1190036 and 1190038 respectively." class="lightbox" src="http://courses.ed.science.psu.edu/bisc002/sites/courses/ed/bisc002/files/bisc002/bisc002_evoless4_pic002.jpg" style="width: 526px; height: 492px; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;" title="Images from NYPL Digital Gallery, Digital ID 1190036 and 1190038 respectively."></span></h4><h4 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Coloration </strong></h4><p style="text-align: justify;">Animals and insects have coloration that allows them to blend into the background of their habitat so they are not easily noticed by predators.</p><ul><li style="text-align: justify;">One insect, for example, looks so much like a leaf it's nearly impossible to tell it's an insect at all.</li></ul><h4 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Escape Mechanisms</strong></h4><p style="text-align: justify;">Other animals have well developed mechanisms for escaping from predators.</p><ul><li style="text-align: justify;">Frogs and rabbits, for example, have leg muscles that are well developed, much more so than any other muscles they have.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Deer have good eyesight, sense of hearing and smell as well as the ability to run well over rough terrain to avoid predators.</li></ul><h4 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Finding/Collecting Food</strong></h4><p style="text-align: justify;">Another significant biotic adaptation deals with the collection of food.</p><ul><li style="text-align: justify;">The beaks of birds are adapted to finding different food sources. Some birds have strong beaks for cracking nuts, other birds have pointed beaks to dig insects out of the bark on trees. Other birds like woodpeckers actually dig into the wood of trees in search of insects.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Long pointed teeth are well adapted for tearing at animal flesh. The canines of most large predators are a good example. Leaf eating animals like cows on the other hand have large flat teeth good for grinding plant matter.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Cats have claws for bringing down prey.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Primates have complex hands that allow for holding and using tools.</li></ul><p style="text-align: justify;">All of these are examples of biotic adaptations to finding food.</p></div></div><p></p>
