<p>Huntingdonâ€™s Disease is a hereditary, progressive, degenerative neurological disorder. It leads to a mixture of physical, thinking ability and mental health problems resulting in profound disability. Onset of the condition is most common between the ages of 30 and 50, although there are about 10% of juvenile cases of the condition. Presently there is no cure for this disease and very few treatments.</p><p>Onset of overt symptoms is most commonly in early middle age, with a mean age of onset between 35 and 44 years in different studies. This is however typically past the age when most affected individuals have already had their families, with potential transmission of the affected gene. The disease typically progresses from symptom onset to advanced disability and death in approximately 15 years. The later the onset of the disease results in a slower progression. In approximately 5-10% of cases, onset is much younger and progresses to death much faster.</p><p>The inheritance pattern for this illness differs from anything discussed so far. In this disease the condition is a Dominant trait. Thus the condition appears in Homozygous dominants as well as Heterozygotes. The only one free of the illness is the Homozygous Recessive. This square shows a case of one parent having the disease by having one defective allele and the other parent being healthy:</p><p><strong><span class="lightbox-processed"><img alt="affected_punnett_square.gif" class="lightbox" height="336" src="http://courses.ed.science.psu.edu/bisc002/sites/courses/ed/bisc002/files/bisc002/images/Huntingdon.gif" style="border-width: 0pt; border-style: solid;" title="affected_punnett_square.gif" width="412"></span></strong></p><p>In this case half of all the offspring will have the disease and half will be free of the illness.</p>
