<p>With more work on the other observable traits of pea plants Mendel was able to gradually work out some rules that inheritance of traits had to follow. He was able to predict with a high degree of statistical validity exactly what each generation would produce. Mendel found that physical characteristics seemed to come in pairs. However when plants having different forms of the trait are cross pollinated, only one of the two forms appears in the offspring. One trait is dominating the other one. The other trait, the recessive one is masked but still present. This <strong>rule of dominance</strong> is a common feature of many genetic characteristics.</p><p><span class="lightbox-processed"><img alt="" class="lightbox" height="407" src="http://courses.ed.science.psu.edu/bisc002/sites/courses/ed/bisc002/files/bisc002/homol.gif" title="" width="399"></span></p><p>Mendel had discovered that for any given characteristic or gene there can be different forms. The term <strong>Allele</strong> is used to describe the alternative forms of a gene. With Mendelâ€™s pea plants the traits always came in pairs but one trait was dominant over the other. This other form of the gene or allele is referred to as the recessive trait.</p>
