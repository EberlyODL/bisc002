<p>In addition to bacteria becoming resistant to antibiotics, other organisms are also becoming resistant to our attempts to control their growth. Insects are a very big problem for farmers. They can infest and destroy the amount of crop that a farmer can harvest in a year. Over the years, many different insects have decimated various crops and have made it difficult for people to get enough food to eat or produce other useful products. The boll weevil once destroyed a large percentage of the cotton grown in the US.</p><p><img alt="Photograph from the Yuma Agricultural Center of the University of Arizona-Yuma" src="http://courses.ed.science.psu.edu/bisc002/sites/courses/ed/bisc002/files/bisc002/bisc002_evoless3_pic021.gif" style="width: 500px; height: 368px;" title="Photograph from the Yuma Agricultural Center of the University of Arizona-Yuma"></p><p>Farmers use a variety of insecticides on their fields to control crop damage due to insects. Aside from environmental concerns when such insecticides are washed into streams and rivers, it seems that the insects themselves are becoming more resistant to such spraying. The pattern is similar to what happens when bacteria are treated by antibiotics. When insects are sprayed with insecticides, the most resistant insects in the population may survive to pass on those resistance genes to offspring. Soon the insects in a field are no longer significantly impacted by the insecticide.</p><p>This of course means that a new insecticide is needed. New insecticides are developed which are effective for some period of time. Then again, the insects begin to develop resistance. The cyclical pattern of new chemical/drug is always followed by a general buildup of resistance in the organism being attacked. The organisms become resistant and the chemical or drug becomes ineffective. Then a new chemical or drug is developed which kicks off a new round of the cycle.</p>
