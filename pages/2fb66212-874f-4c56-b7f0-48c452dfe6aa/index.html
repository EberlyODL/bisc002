<p>Scientists use certain terms to describe scientific knowledge in very specific ways. The meaning of the term "fact" or "law" or "theory" has certain meanings to scientists that are not always exactly the same the meanings that the rest of use have. Some of these terms include:</p>
<ol start="1"><li>Fact</li><li>Hypothesis</li><li>Theory</li><li>Law</li></ol>
<p><strong>Facts</strong> are most often invoked when someone wants to imply that an observation cannot be disputed. Sometimes that is actually true, in science; today's fact can become yesterday's wrong idea. Often times the idea of a fact is more an historical concept than an absolute truth. If the ideas found in today's science textbooks are outdated within a few decades, how can any facts then be believed?</p>
<p>Perhaps it's best to think of facts as <em>bits of scientific knowledge that have not been refuted to date</em>. At one time everyone "knew" the Earth was flat. In those days, it wasn't possible to travel in one direction long enough to end up right back where they started. Yet that's exactly what would happen if you tried the same thing today using an airplane. It took many years and a number of observations for everyone to agree the world is in fact round. Interestingly, there are those who still believe the Earth is flat after all. If anyone could make an accurate observation that the Earth is indeed flat, then it would change the fact that the Earth is round. To date, no one has managed to offer such proof thus we have the fact that the earth is round.</p>
<p><strong>Laws</strong> are generalizations about a body of observations. They show consistent relationships between facts, observations and variables. Laws are often used to make predictions about what you'll see in a given situation. They are used to explain what will happen but not necessarily to explain why it happens. For example, Newton came up with the law of gravity and he could tell what would happen when an object was dropped or thrown in an arc but he could not explain why it happened.</p>
<p>Laws are also subject to further refinement just like other scientific ideas. Sometimes laws work under certain conditions but not under other conditions previously untested. Newton's laws of physics don't always work as expected when studying physics at the subatomic level. The way planets orbit the sun is not the same way electrons orbit in an atom. Therefore, the conditions under which any particular law is applied must be considered.</p>
<p>Theories and hypotheses are attempts to make sense of a collection of observations. A <strong>theory</strong> describes a set of ideas that explain and interpret facts, observations and events. Any theory includes some set of hypotheses which are testable statements designed to explain the value of a set of observations. A <strong>hypothesis</strong> is basically an educated guess that can be tested. It's possible to disprove a hypothesis but one can never prove it to be true. If a hypothesis is repeatedly tested and never found to be incorrect we can then believe that it is likely to be true. Still there is always the possibility that some new information in the future will disprove the hypothesis.</p>
<p>Once a series of hypotheses shows itself unable to be disproven then these hypotheses are taken together as a theory. A lawyer may use the term "theory" to describe a supposition or something that may be true but a scientist views a theory as a valid explanation of an event that has never been disproven. The longer a theory exists despite attempt after attempt to disprove it, the more likely we are to&nbsp;think that the theory is an accurate explanation.</p>

<p>There exists a specific relationship between facts and theories. Facts and observations are used to form and then test hypotheses. If the hypotheses hold up under scrutiny, a theory is formed to explain the observations and facts. When new facts arise they are in turn used to either support or contradict the theory. Sometimes the theory requires modification and it becomes a better, sturdier theory. In the end the theory is just the best explanation of the available facts. Some theories are well tested over decades of research; others are newer and undergo modification. No theory can ever be presented as ultimate truth. It's always a work in progress!</p>
