<p>Hemoglobin is a protein in Red Blood Cells that carries Oxygen and Carbon Dioxide. In sickle cell anemia there is a defect in the hemoglobin gene that involves a single nucleotide change. One of the letters is wrong. A missense mutation changes the sequence and the amino acid valine is used instead of the regular glutamic acid. How this happens will be discussed in a later lesson.</p><p>Because of this mutation in the hemoglobin gene, the hemoglobin that is produced has a tendency to stick together in a red blood cell which causes the cell to form a sharp bend. This sickle shaped cell has a tendency to break apart when passing through capillaries which causes a person to become anemic. Other more serious and life threatening complications can also occur. Most people with this disease only live into their 40â€™s.</p><h2>Normal allele - Hb A</h2><p>Normal Red Blood Cells are disc shaped as seen in this image. The normal hemoglobin allele HbA produces normal hemoglobin and red blood cells which are quite flexible and able to squeeze through blood vessels.</p><p><strong><span class="lightbox-processed"><img alt="healthy_redCells.jpg" class="lightbox" src="http://courses.ed.science.psu.edu/bisc002/sites/courses/ed/bisc002/files/bisc002/redbloodcells.jpg" style="border-width: 0pt; border-style: solid; width: 286px; height: 191px;" title="healthy_redCells.jpg"></span></strong></p><h2>Defective allele - Hb S</h2><p>Persons who have two of the sickle cell trait, HbS produce cells with sharp edges. These cells tend to break apart of get stuck in blood vessels and shut off the flow of blood.</p><h2><strong><span class="lightbox-processed"><img alt="sickelCells.jpg" class="lightbox" src="http://courses.ed.science.psu.edu/bisc002/sites/courses/ed/bisc002/files/bisc002/SickleCells.jpg" style="border-width: 0pt; border-style: solid; width: 325px; height: 217px; margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px;" title="sickelCells.jpg"></span></strong></h2><h2>Genetics of Sickle Cell Anemia</h2><p>A person with both normal traits, HbA&nbsp; HbA, does not have sickle cell anemia or the trait (the Homozygous Dominant). A person with the disease has both defective traits, HbS&nbsp; HbS. This is the Homozygous Recessive. If a person is a carrier for the trait, HbA HbS, they show no sickle cell anemia because enough normal hemoglobin is produced that there is no significant clinical problem. However, as a carrier of the trait such individuals can pass the sickle cell gene on to offspring. In the US, about 1 in 500 African American children have sickle cell anemia.</p>
