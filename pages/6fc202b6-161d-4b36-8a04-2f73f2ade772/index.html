<h2>Biodiversity on Earth must be preserved</h2>
<p>During this course, we have learnt that life has existed on Earth for 3 billion years and is constantly evolving and changing. This has created&nbsp;extraordinary diversity on our planet, without which humans cannot survive. We depend on a huge number of other organisms for food, shelter, warmth and even compounds that cure disease.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tiny microbes, such as bacteria, carry out essential tasks - some of which you might not even realize! Did you know that there are actually more bacterial cells in your body than human ones? They outnumber our cells by 10X, and help us to fully digest food in our intestines so that we can absorb the nutrients we need. Plants purify the air by absorbing carbon dioxide and producing oxygen, insects help to pollinate plants including the ones we use to produce crops. Even animals that are no longer with us provide energy in the form of fossil fuels.</p>
<p>Despite the level to which we rely on other species, our activities are harming biodiversity. Earth is in the midst of a "<strong>biodiversity crisis</strong>", affecting plants, animals and other organisms. It is estimated that the rate of extinction has sped up 100 to 1000 times since we intervened, a level&nbsp;that&nbsp;is comparable to the rate during the 5 mass extinctions that we discussed in week 13.</p>
<p>The biggest thread to biodiversity is <strong>habitat destruction</strong>. Humans have altered almost 50% of the land to make way for our&nbsp;roads and cities. Mass deforestation means that trees who once purified our air are no longer there, not to mention the populations of small animals that have been forced to find a new home.&nbsp;Another huge problem is&nbsp;<strong>pollution</strong>&nbsp;that comes from burning of fuels and other waste products including toxic chemicals. Pollution degrades the quality of water, air and land, affecting biodiversity worldwide.</p>
